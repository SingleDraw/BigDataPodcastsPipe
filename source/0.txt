[00:00:00 --> 00:00:06] The joke, Rogan, experience.
[00:00:06 --> 00:00:10] Train my day, Joe Rogan, podcast, my night, all day.
[00:00:10 --> 00:00:15] And we're up, my friend, how are you?
[00:00:15 --> 00:00:16] Good to see you.
[00:00:16 --> 00:00:17] Long time no talk.
[00:00:17 --> 00:00:18] Yeah, brother.
[00:00:18 --> 00:00:19] Yeah.
[00:00:19 --> 00:00:20] Are you doing good?
[00:00:20 --> 00:00:21] Good.
[00:00:21 --> 00:00:25] I remember, like, towards the last, the end of the last time I was here.
[00:00:25 --> 00:00:26] You said, oh, yeah.
[00:00:26 --> 00:00:28] We'll probably see you again in a couple years.
[00:00:28 --> 00:00:31] And I was just looking around like, yeah, I'll never see any of this again.
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:33] You're back quicker than you thought.
[00:00:33 --> 00:00:34] Yeah.
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:37] Bro, that new song is Fire.
[00:00:37 --> 00:00:38] Thanks.
[00:00:38 --> 00:00:39] Yeah.
[00:00:39 --> 00:00:41] I played that song about 20 times in the green room.
[00:00:41 --> 00:00:46] And the first time I played it, everybody just sat around and went, oh, shit.
[00:00:46 --> 00:00:50] It was so funny that, um, yeah, I didn't expect the song.
[00:00:50 --> 00:00:52] Well, you know, I didn't, I wasn't the one.
[00:00:52 --> 00:00:54] I guess it was Adam that sent it.
[00:00:54 --> 00:00:56] I don't even know how you got a hold of the song originally.
[00:00:56 --> 00:00:57] Yeah.
[00:00:57 --> 00:00:58] I sent it to me originally.
[00:00:58 --> 00:00:59] Yeah.
[00:00:59 --> 00:01:05] I sent it to him like, um, yeah, just kind of just to get his opinion of it or whatever.
[00:01:05 --> 00:01:06] And he's like, I got it.
[00:01:06 --> 00:01:08] He's like, do you mind if I share this around?
[00:01:08 --> 00:01:09] And I was like, yeah, go ahead.
[00:01:09 --> 00:01:11] Well, the first time I heard it was in the green room.
[00:01:11 --> 00:01:14] And the green room has a killer sound system.
[00:01:14 --> 00:01:18] So we put it on the Bluetooth and cranked it in all of us.
[00:01:18 --> 00:01:21] There's like 10 dudes in that room going, oh, shit.
[00:01:21 --> 00:01:22] Oh, shit.
[00:01:22 --> 00:01:25] Some of those lies like, oh, shit.
[00:01:25 --> 00:01:26] Yeah.
[00:01:27 --> 00:01:29] What makes that song different, I guess,
[00:01:29 --> 00:01:33] than anything I've done or than a lot of music now is that we're, um,
[00:01:33 --> 00:01:37] we tried to, like, do it the way Leonard Skinner or somebody would back in this,
[00:01:37 --> 00:01:40] where we're all just in the house and there's no, like, man,
[00:01:40 --> 00:01:43] there's so much editing that goes into music now on the back end and stuff.
[00:01:43 --> 00:01:45] And with this, we're just like in there doing it.
[00:01:45 --> 00:01:49] And, you know, try to keep it as real as possible.
[00:01:49 --> 00:01:52] Like, um, you know, there's no, there's no click tracks.
[00:01:52 --> 00:01:53] There's no real editing.
[00:01:53 --> 00:01:55] It's just kind of like we're all just in this house.
[00:01:55 --> 00:01:59] I mean, it's, it was, is the worst timing they've recorded, but, um,
[00:01:59 --> 00:02:03] that was, that January 5th, 6th, 7th window was the only time
[00:02:03 --> 00:02:04] that everybody can meet up, you know, Billy,
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:06] contraris on the fiddle and everybody.
[00:02:06 --> 00:02:08] And because he, he tours with Ricky Skags,
[00:02:08 --> 00:02:10] and he's kind of all over the place.
[00:02:10 --> 00:02:11] So that was like our time to meet.
[00:02:11 --> 00:02:15] So a couple of days before we all went to West Virginia to record
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:19] in my house up there, the, um, this like terrible storm they were calling for.
[00:02:19 --> 00:02:21] It's like the worst one since the 90s supposedly,
[00:02:21 --> 00:02:22] or that's what Draven says.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:25] But, so we got all the snow, all the size.
[00:02:25 --> 00:02:30] So, um, so yeah, we used a side by side in a Jeep to haul everything up and down.
[00:02:30 --> 00:02:33] It was like, just all we could do to get up and down to the house.
[00:02:33 --> 00:02:35] And then it's right as soon as we get everything plugged in,
[00:02:35 --> 00:02:37] ready to go the power knocks out.
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:42] And, uh, I was like, we were all just so discouraged.
[00:02:42 --> 00:02:44] And, um, luckily there, you know, there's a lows,
[00:02:44 --> 00:02:46] not terribly far away.
[00:02:46 --> 00:02:49] And they had one, they had like a Honda inverter generator
[00:02:49 --> 00:02:51] that was like safe to plug everything into.
[00:02:51 --> 00:02:55] You know, like a, where the waves aren't going to mess everything up.
[00:02:55 --> 00:02:58] And, um, so yeah, we, you know, we recorded this on,
[00:02:58 --> 00:02:59] while on a generator.
[00:02:59 --> 00:03:03] So you have to worry about the waves of the generally the sound of the generator.
[00:03:03 --> 00:03:04] Or like, is that what it is?
[00:03:04 --> 00:03:05] No, like the electrical.
[00:03:05 --> 00:03:06] Yes, yes.
[00:03:06 --> 00:03:09] Like plugging all of that expensive equipment in to just like a,
[00:03:09 --> 00:03:12] uh, yeah, a generator that's on an inverter, like the voltage,
[00:03:12 --> 00:03:14] like goes up and down, I guess, sir.
[00:03:14 --> 00:03:15] I don't know.
[00:03:15 --> 00:03:16] That's all above my pay grade.
[00:03:16 --> 00:03:20] But we had to find one that was like safe to plug all that equipment into, you know.
[00:03:21 --> 00:03:25] Well, it, maybe that's something in the song, too.
[00:03:25 --> 00:03:28] You know, like maybe that you're trapped in a storm.
[00:03:28 --> 00:03:30] But that's a scary ass song, dude.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:32] It's a scare.
[00:03:32 --> 00:03:35] I can't wait for the, yeah, see, I hadn't put a lot of new music out
[00:03:35 --> 00:03:41] because, um, well, I think back to even when I was here last time
[00:03:41 --> 00:03:44] and before we did the episode and all, um,
[00:03:44 --> 00:03:47] walking around on the sidewalk out in front of the hotel with driving
[00:03:47 --> 00:03:51] up, other people arguing that I needed to just catch up from Richmond and roll
[00:03:51 --> 00:03:55] and not make this into a long term thing because I just, um,
[00:03:55 --> 00:03:58] well, dude, I just don't, some people thrive in this environment,
[00:03:58 --> 00:03:59] like everybody looking at them.
[00:03:59 --> 00:04:02] But I, to me, it's just like, uh, so it just, it kind of takes,
[00:04:02 --> 00:04:05] it kind of takes a little bit out of me putting new music out.
[00:04:05 --> 00:04:08] And so, you know, after Richmond only had this two new songs,
[00:04:08 --> 00:04:11] I really just wanted to let everything kind of slow down.
[00:04:11 --> 00:04:15] And I could still maybe do five or ten shows a year and make a little bit,
[00:04:15 --> 00:04:17] but I wasn't trying to be like a superstar.
[00:04:17 --> 00:04:19] I didn't want everybody just to be,
[00:04:19 --> 00:04:21] I didn't want to be stuck in that spot.
[00:04:21 --> 00:04:23] I was when I was at Richmond where everybody's just, like,
[00:04:23 --> 00:04:26] obsessing over stuff and so I kind of just tried to let it die.
[00:04:26 --> 00:04:28] And then it, you know, it wouldn't.
[00:04:28 --> 00:04:33] It was like, the streams kept continuing and people were still messaging me and emailing
[00:04:33 --> 00:04:36] and the shows were still selling out and I just realized, like,
[00:04:36 --> 00:04:40] I don't know, you know, I believed everybody that said,
[00:04:40 --> 00:04:43] this kid's got 15 minutes of fame and whatever and I would have been
[00:04:43 --> 00:04:45] during when Richmond blew up.
[00:04:45 --> 00:04:47] I would have been one of those guys who would have been like,
[00:04:47 --> 00:04:48] oh, that's stupid guy.
[00:04:48 --> 00:04:50] You know, like, I would have been a hater too.
[00:04:50 --> 00:04:53] So I was almost like rooting for them, like, yeah.
[00:04:53 --> 00:04:55] You know, because you got to think, man,
[00:04:55 --> 00:04:58] the first check from Richmond was $800,000.
[00:04:58 --> 00:05:01] Like, I could have lived a long time off of that money, you know,
[00:05:01 --> 00:05:03] like, I don't need a whole lot of, like, that was great.
[00:05:03 --> 00:05:06] You know, that was a decade or more of work for me easily.
[00:05:06 --> 00:05:08] And when I was like, I was like, heck, yeah,
[00:05:08 --> 00:05:09] I'm good.
[00:05:09 --> 00:05:10] I'll just take it, you know.
[00:05:10 --> 00:05:14] And anyway, I say all that to say that now, it's like,
[00:05:14 --> 00:05:17] I'm going to at least just hit it good one more time.
[00:05:17 --> 00:05:20] I've got, we've got six songs recorded now to come
[00:05:20 --> 00:05:22] after scoring full debt or all, like,
[00:05:22 --> 00:05:24] I'm pretty proud of them, they're good.
[00:05:24 --> 00:05:27] And so I'm going to put those out and then who knows after that.
[00:05:27 --> 00:05:29] But let me tell you what's going to happen.
[00:05:29 --> 00:05:32] You've got a relationship with those people now, man.
[00:05:32 --> 00:05:33] They love you.
[00:05:33 --> 00:05:34] Yeah.
[00:05:34 --> 00:05:38] It's just your mission in life.
[00:05:38 --> 00:05:41] You know, you just got handed a wild hand of cards.
[00:05:41 --> 00:05:43] And this is your deck of cards.
[00:05:43 --> 00:05:47] You know, your deck of cards is, or your hand of cards is,
[00:05:47 --> 00:05:51] you put this song out, this authentic song.
[00:05:51 --> 00:05:52] That's very simple.
[00:05:52 --> 00:05:54] In this time, we're nothing simple.
[00:05:54 --> 00:05:57] In this time where everything's confusing and,
[00:05:57 --> 00:06:00] you don't know who's telling the truth.
[00:06:00 --> 00:06:02] The news is lying to you.
[00:06:02 --> 00:06:04] Everything is being funded.
[00:06:04 --> 00:06:05] Nothing's organic.
[00:06:06 --> 00:06:09] It's half the fucking traffic on social media's bots.
[00:06:09 --> 00:06:10] It leased.
[00:06:10 --> 00:06:11] Yeah.
[00:06:11 --> 00:06:12] Politicians are lying.
[00:06:12 --> 00:06:14] Everybody's confused.
[00:06:14 --> 00:06:16] People are simple for politicians.
[00:06:16 --> 00:06:20] They're getting paid to repeat talking points on television.
[00:06:20 --> 00:06:22] And on podcasts and all over social media.
[00:06:22 --> 00:06:24] So when someone comes on with something like that,
[00:06:24 --> 00:06:27] it's just that dude telling you how he feels.
[00:06:27 --> 00:06:28] Yeah.
[00:06:28 --> 00:06:29] Real raw.
[00:06:29 --> 00:06:32] You know, I remember we had that conversation on the phone.
[00:06:32 --> 00:06:34] And I was like, if you can do that, you can do that again.
[00:06:34 --> 00:06:36] You don't, they don't need anybody else.
[00:06:36 --> 00:06:39] You don't need these motherfuckers who want you to cash out.
[00:06:39 --> 00:06:43] All these, they're, they're doing that because they think that you're gollable.
[00:06:43 --> 00:06:48] They think that you're naive in the ways of the entertainment music business.
[00:06:48 --> 00:06:55] The first fucking live show you ever performed was a giant sold-out show at a state fair.
[00:06:55 --> 00:06:56] You know, crazy that is?
[00:06:56 --> 00:06:57] This is your first watch.
[00:06:57 --> 00:06:58] Yeah.
[00:06:58 --> 00:07:02] That very first show was actually, it was even more amateur than that.
[00:07:02 --> 00:07:04] It was at a farm market.
[00:07:04 --> 00:07:07] It wasn't even a, there weren't even any tickets.
[00:07:07 --> 00:07:11] It was just like, so it's crazy how it all, it just, it goes back to when I,
[00:07:11 --> 00:07:14] I still believe, just as much now as I did the last time I was here about it.
[00:07:14 --> 00:07:17] And I definitely won't bug everybody too much with all my hokey,
[00:07:17 --> 00:07:18] poke, religious stuff either.
[00:07:18 --> 00:07:20] Like I definitely want to read a little bit up before we go.
[00:07:20 --> 00:07:24] But I do believe it was just, it was all too perfectly timed.
[00:07:24 --> 00:07:28] But I had actually picked that date out at the farm market before Richmond blew up.
[00:07:28 --> 00:07:31] That was going to be my first time playing live either way.
[00:07:31 --> 00:07:32] That date.
[00:07:32 --> 00:07:34] It was like August the 12th, I think.
[00:07:34 --> 00:07:37] I had booked it back in July with that Morris farm market.
[00:07:37 --> 00:07:41] I was going to get 200 bucks and go play for like, it was like two and a half hours.
[00:07:41 --> 00:07:42] Like seriously.
[00:07:42 --> 00:07:46] And in that time, that's what, so like I already had that date picked in.
[00:07:46 --> 00:07:50] Yeah, it was just that a farm market and got kind of near the beach and other banks.
[00:07:50 --> 00:07:52] And they say like 12,000 people showed up.
[00:07:52 --> 00:07:55] That was the very first one.
[00:07:55 --> 00:07:56] Yeah.
[00:07:56 --> 00:08:00] And I just, I remember even then, like I just expected everybody.
[00:08:00 --> 00:08:02] I just expected everybody to sing Richmond and that was going to be it.
[00:08:02 --> 00:08:04] And it'd be cool when I'd go back to work the next week.
[00:08:04 --> 00:08:07] But it was like even in that crowd at that very first show, all the other songs.
[00:08:07 --> 00:08:09] They knew the words too, too.
[00:08:09 --> 00:08:11] And I was like, this is like something, you know.
[00:08:11 --> 00:08:17] But the important thing too is that the important thing to take away from this.
[00:08:17 --> 00:08:18] And I said this during Richmond.
[00:08:18 --> 00:08:22] But you know, it was like, take me out of it.
[00:08:22 --> 00:08:27] The fact that people can now choose what they want and push it to the top,
[00:08:27 --> 00:08:30] even in a system that's rigged where there is bots.
[00:08:30 --> 00:08:33] And there's mass marketing money going in the songs.
[00:08:33 --> 00:08:37] And like labels spend a million dollars on their own song to get it up the label.
[00:08:37 --> 00:08:38] Yeah.
[00:08:38 --> 00:08:42] The fact that people can just decide they like something and just shoot it up to the top.
[00:08:42 --> 00:08:45] Like people need to realize how much power and influence they have.
[00:08:45 --> 00:08:47] At least for a short period in time in society.
[00:08:47 --> 00:08:50] It's like the stars are aligned where we can kind of.
[00:08:50 --> 00:08:51] It's funny.
[00:08:51 --> 00:08:56] Technology like can only develop on the backs of people using it.
[00:08:56 --> 00:09:01] And so like AI and and all of this over the years social media like all the back end of that.
[00:09:01 --> 00:09:06] It's been it's all that information being sort of extracted from us.
[00:09:06 --> 00:09:10] Like you think about like the like the way in a Tesla car rides on the road and it's watching you drive.
[00:09:10 --> 00:09:14] And you're like it's like reading your analytics so it can learn how to drive better.
[00:09:14 --> 00:09:19] We know AI that's the only reason why they let everybody use AI is so it can make the AI.
[00:09:19 --> 00:09:22] It's the user input that's what makes it.
[00:09:22 --> 00:09:30] And so for a very short period in time it's like the stars are aligned where they're having to like while they're sucking all the humanity out of us to put into this AI.
[00:09:30 --> 00:09:36] We also have full access to it and like so we can do like even in the even in the music business.
[00:09:36 --> 00:09:44] You know everything that the label used to help exclusive control over like the publicity and the marketing and the digital streaming service relationships.
[00:09:44 --> 00:09:50] Like all that stuff is now just alicard to anybody like you don't need the you don't need those big companies all that stuff.
[00:09:50 --> 00:10:00] You can just go and hire a really good social media person and you can work with the good music distributor without having to sign anything or give any of your rights up and right now the people have the power is.
[00:10:00 --> 00:10:01] but I mean, for like a very short period of time,
[00:10:01 --> 00:10:04] but this should just be a reminder of that.
[00:10:04 --> 00:10:07] This song being able to go up into the iTunes charts,
[00:10:07 --> 00:10:10] even with stuff, with way bigger audiences
[00:10:10 --> 00:10:11] with all kinds of marketing reach.
[00:10:11 --> 00:10:13] You know, the fact that this can just organically go
[00:10:13 --> 00:10:15] into the iTunes charts like that.
[00:10:15 --> 00:10:18] And people, you know, it's just, that's the thing.
[00:10:18 --> 00:10:20] That's the thing I always take away from it
[00:10:20 --> 00:10:21] is just like damn, dude.
[00:10:21 --> 00:10:24] If we could just get organized, even for like two or three years,
[00:10:24 --> 00:10:25] we could just fix everything.
[00:10:25 --> 00:10:29] Like, the people really do have the power, at least right now,
[00:10:29 --> 00:10:32] for a short window of time, but we really do.
[00:10:32 --> 00:10:34] I mean, we, but people have to understand
[00:10:34 --> 00:10:36] that we are all in this together,
[00:10:36 --> 00:10:40] and that there's organizations that want to drive us apart.
[00:10:40 --> 00:10:41] And the way to work out our differences
[00:10:41 --> 00:10:45] is having conversations and negotiations
[00:10:45 --> 00:10:47] and figuring out how to work it out.
[00:10:47 --> 00:10:49] It's not lighting cop cars on fire.
[00:10:49 --> 00:10:52] Like, this is, you know?
[00:10:52 --> 00:10:55] But the spirit of those, like, not to defend any of that crap,
[00:10:55 --> 00:10:57] but I just, that rebellious nature
[00:10:57 --> 00:10:58] and us is important, too, though.
[00:10:58 --> 00:11:02] It just has to be, it has to be directed correctly.
[00:11:02 --> 00:11:04] You shouldn't be burdening way,
[00:11:04 --> 00:11:07] most while holding a Mexican flag, trying not to get said
[00:11:07 --> 00:11:08] back to Mexico.
[00:11:08 --> 00:11:10] I mean, you're confusing the fuck out of me, dog.
[00:11:10 --> 00:11:13] Like, who is your presser?
[00:11:13 --> 00:11:15] Is it the electric car?
[00:11:15 --> 00:11:19] Is it the country, which, you know, you want to stay,
[00:11:19 --> 00:11:21] but you're holding a flag of another country?
[00:11:21 --> 00:11:23] Like, why you wearing a mask?
[00:11:23 --> 00:11:24] Are you proud of this?
[00:11:24 --> 00:11:26] Do you not want to get arrested?
[00:11:26 --> 00:11:27] What are we doing?
[00:11:27 --> 00:11:28] Are you scared of COVID?
[00:11:28 --> 00:11:29] Like, I want to know.
[00:11:29 --> 00:11:35] Well, it goes back to what you said about mass manipulation
[00:11:35 --> 00:11:38] and also like, we've all sort of lost our identity.
[00:11:38 --> 00:11:40] That's why politics has become so prevalent
[00:11:40 --> 00:11:44] and like, the way people represent themselves to other people.
[00:11:44 --> 00:11:49] And like, you know, as our culture and our tradition
[00:11:49 --> 00:11:53] and like sort of the knowledge of where our families
[00:11:53 --> 00:11:54] and all of that stuff comes from,
[00:11:54 --> 00:11:56] like, we're just sort of all,
[00:11:56 --> 00:11:57] we're just little boats out in the big ocean
[00:11:57 --> 00:11:59] and we're looking for somewhere to,
[00:11:59 --> 00:12:01] we're looking for some kind of identity
[00:12:01 --> 00:12:03] to reach out and grab and politics.
[00:12:03 --> 00:12:05] They make politics so easy to reach out and grab
[00:12:05 --> 00:12:06] and make just like in the same way
[00:12:06 --> 00:12:09] that people just absorb themselves into sports.
[00:12:09 --> 00:12:09] Exactly.
[00:12:09 --> 00:12:11] You know, they're at way out of shape,
[00:12:11 --> 00:12:13] but they like, they refer to their sports team
[00:12:13 --> 00:12:16] as we, like, all our defense did really does that all the time.
[00:12:16 --> 00:12:17] We won.
[00:12:17 --> 00:12:19] Talk about a college, where I'm from.
[00:12:19 --> 00:12:21] Some college, where he's from.
[00:12:21 --> 00:12:21] Well, that's up.
[00:12:21 --> 00:12:23] Maybe.
[00:12:23 --> 00:12:24] Get out of here.
[00:12:24 --> 00:12:25] Maybe if he's from there,
[00:12:25 --> 00:12:26] then it doesn't count.
[00:12:26 --> 00:12:27] I'm just fucking around.
[00:12:27 --> 00:12:28] Yeah.
[00:12:28 --> 00:12:30] I'm not a team sports guy.
[00:12:30 --> 00:12:32] You know, I'm a combat sports guy
[00:12:32 --> 00:12:33] and I would never say we won.
[00:12:33 --> 00:12:37] Like a tomorrow, Oosmara, beat somebody I never say we won.
[00:12:37 --> 00:12:39] You know, come on, I would call me up.
[00:12:39 --> 00:12:42] But the fuck are you saying man, we, you know what I didn't camp?
[00:12:42 --> 00:12:44] You know, I mean, rounds I spark, you know?
[00:12:44 --> 00:12:47] Yeah, all the punches he took.
[00:12:47 --> 00:12:48] It's so crazy.
[00:12:48 --> 00:12:50] It was a group of guys you can say we.
[00:12:50 --> 00:12:52] But that's, I see that, like,
[00:12:52 --> 00:12:54] I just see that becoming more and more prevalent
[00:12:54 --> 00:12:58] where there's not like, I don't know.
[00:12:58 --> 00:13:02] It's sort of just like, it's kind of even, even to expand
[00:13:02 --> 00:13:03] on the thought of it.
[00:13:03 --> 00:13:06] It's even like the way that now we've all just sort of,
[00:13:06 --> 00:13:08] we're all in these subcategories of the way we would be
[00:13:08 --> 00:13:09] if we were in prison.
[00:13:09 --> 00:13:11] We're all like, you know, like in the same way
[00:13:11 --> 00:13:14] that when we use the word black and white to describe,
[00:13:14 --> 00:13:17] like, how many different types of white and black
[00:13:17 --> 00:13:19] are there that all just get merged?
[00:13:19 --> 00:13:22] It's like, it's like, creates this maybe like group identity
[00:13:22 --> 00:13:24] that's a lot easier to control.
[00:13:24 --> 00:13:27] Like, sure, well, and then it shifts over time.
[00:13:27 --> 00:13:29] Like, my family wasn't white.
[00:13:29 --> 00:13:30] My family was Italian.
[00:13:30 --> 00:13:32] They were, they were disparage when they first came
[00:13:32 --> 00:13:34] to America from Europe.
[00:13:34 --> 00:13:36] And my grandfather just told me terrible stories
[00:13:36 --> 00:13:37] wouldn't happen to him when he was a boy,
[00:13:37 --> 00:13:39] living in America as an Italian.
[00:13:39 --> 00:13:42] They treated them the same way terribly racist people
[00:13:42 --> 00:13:45] or treating people from Guatemala that's naked here.
[00:13:45 --> 00:13:46] And it's the same kind of thing.
[00:13:46 --> 00:13:50] Then after a while, they sort of integrated it and now white.
[00:13:50 --> 00:13:52] Yeah, now you're just a white person.
[00:13:52 --> 00:13:54] That's just a regular white.
[00:13:54 --> 00:13:57] But it's easy now and they're like in big public narrative
[00:13:57 --> 00:14:01] and stuff to it's a lot easier to accuse you
[00:14:01 --> 00:14:04] and 30 other different nationalities of people
[00:14:04 --> 00:14:06] who were all very culturally different and unique
[00:14:06 --> 00:14:08] and just call all of you white people.
[00:14:08 --> 00:14:10] And then pick the worst thing that one of those nationalities
[00:14:10 --> 00:14:12] did and just cast it among the whole group.
[00:14:12 --> 00:14:16] But it happens with that with every ethnicity, every identity.
[00:14:16 --> 00:14:18] The goal is to like put everyone in the world
[00:14:18 --> 00:14:20] and one of three or four buckets.
[00:14:20 --> 00:14:22] And then hopefully figure out how to just put all of them
[00:14:22 --> 00:14:23] into one bucket eventually.
[00:14:23 --> 00:14:26] It's like it's just it's so much easier to control two
[00:14:26 --> 00:14:28] or three different types of people than it is 30 or 40
[00:14:28 --> 00:14:30] or 100 or 1000, you know?
[00:14:30 --> 00:14:33] Which is also I think why they never fix the problems
[00:14:33 --> 00:14:35] that AL are inner cities.
[00:14:35 --> 00:14:38] They want to keep that conflict.
[00:14:38 --> 00:14:39] I really believe that.
[00:14:39 --> 00:14:43] Because if somebody wanted to have a better stronger economy,
[00:14:43 --> 00:14:45] the first thing you would do is you want more people
[00:14:45 --> 00:14:46] in the workforce.
[00:14:46 --> 00:14:49] So you'd want less people that are disenfranchised,
[00:14:49 --> 00:14:53] completely out of society, felons, all that stuff.
[00:14:53 --> 00:14:56] That doesn't do anything but cost the country money, right?
[00:14:56 --> 00:14:59] Unless you have private prisons.
[00:14:59 --> 00:15:01] Now private prisons, those people become a business.
[00:15:01 --> 00:15:05] And then that business contributes to the escalation of laws.
[00:15:05 --> 00:15:08] And they want to make sure that law is staying place
[00:15:08 --> 00:15:10] because that way their businesses always fall.
[00:15:10 --> 00:15:11] They have plenty of customers.
[00:15:11 --> 00:15:13] Their customers are human beings
[00:15:13 --> 00:15:16] that they turn into batteries to generate money.
[00:15:16 --> 00:15:17] That's what it is.
[00:15:17 --> 00:15:19] Like those people, every person they have in there,
[00:15:19 --> 00:15:23] they get more money, which is wild.
[00:15:23 --> 00:15:24] It's wild that we allow that.
[00:15:24 --> 00:15:28] But then it's also like keeping a certain amount of crime
[00:15:28 --> 00:15:31] in certain areas, ensures that you're always
[00:15:31 --> 00:15:33] going to have debates over law enforcement.
[00:15:33 --> 00:15:36] You're always going to have conversations over disenfranch...
[00:15:36 --> 00:15:40] We need DEI, we need this, we need quotas.
[00:15:40 --> 00:15:44] We need to hire more people of this sort of that,
[00:15:44 --> 00:15:47] ignoring the fact that there's a lot of these things
[00:15:47 --> 00:15:50] especially with universities are the most racist,
[00:15:50 --> 00:15:52] especially towards Asians.
[00:15:52 --> 00:15:54] The racist is fucked towards Asians.
[00:15:54 --> 00:15:56] There's lawsuits about it.
[00:15:56 --> 00:16:00] Harvard is that's still going on the Harvard lawsuit
[00:16:00 --> 00:16:04] where they specifically made their application process,
[00:16:04 --> 00:16:06] like the whole acceptance process,
[00:16:06 --> 00:16:07] more difficult for Asians,
[00:16:07 --> 00:16:09] because they were kicking too much ass.
[00:16:09 --> 00:16:12] They had too many Asian people that were willing
[00:16:12 --> 00:16:15] to fucking work their ass off, study 12 hours a day,
[00:16:15 --> 00:16:18] get straight A, he's like, man, as too many of these folks.
[00:16:18 --> 00:16:19] We got to make it tough for her.
[00:16:19 --> 00:16:22] What did they do to make it more difficult, specifically?
[00:16:22 --> 00:16:23] They attached a bunch of things.
[00:16:23 --> 00:16:25] I believe the argument is they attached a bunch
[00:16:25 --> 00:16:28] of things like social stuff,
[00:16:28 --> 00:16:33] like how much do you engage in activism,
[00:16:33 --> 00:16:38] how often are you involved in social activities on campus?
[00:16:38 --> 00:16:41] What are the things are you doing other than just
[00:16:41 --> 00:16:43] pure academic work?
[00:16:43 --> 00:16:46] They're trying to slow them down.
[00:16:46 --> 00:16:48] They're literally trying to slow them down.
[00:16:48 --> 00:16:52] Yeah, that's another great example, too,
[00:16:52 --> 00:16:57] like even just that they can blank it, Asian like that,
[00:16:57 --> 00:17:02] as such a, it's Indian, it's Chinese, there's a lot of,
[00:17:02 --> 00:17:05] but yeah, people that come from a hard place
[00:17:05 --> 00:17:06] are willing to work hard.
[00:17:06 --> 00:17:07] That's the difference.
[00:17:07 --> 00:17:10] And the problem with meritocracy,
[00:17:10 --> 00:17:12] is that some other fuckers will go for it.
[00:17:12 --> 00:17:14] And if you get a whole country of people going for it,
[00:17:14 --> 00:17:16] that gets scary for the people that just want to take naps.
[00:17:16 --> 00:17:18] It's the same psychology that goes in,
[00:17:18 --> 00:17:21] like in a lot of the smaller Apple Action towns,
[00:17:21 --> 00:17:25] like where we recorded was really close to Bramwell, West Virginia,
[00:17:25 --> 00:17:29] but if you look at, even if you look at Bramwell, West Virginia,
[00:17:29 --> 00:17:31] and their recent political history, like the last mayor
[00:17:31 --> 00:17:34] they had, she embossled money from the town,
[00:17:34 --> 00:17:37] and there was like, you know, and this is in a very small tent,
[00:17:37 --> 00:17:41] like, so government corruption exists like everywhere.
[00:17:41 --> 00:17:44] And it almost is like, maybe in those big cities,
[00:17:44 --> 00:17:47] I understand definitely that I think things are intentionally
[00:17:47 --> 00:17:49] neglected like to create chaos.
[00:17:49 --> 00:17:52] And they create this like you said, this need for more resources
[00:17:52 --> 00:17:55] and more, but it's also just that maybe a lot of those people
[00:17:55 --> 00:17:57] that are in positions are just very spineless
[00:17:57 --> 00:17:59] and self-centered, and like, they don't even care
[00:17:59 --> 00:18:00] that people are dying in their streets.
[00:18:00 --> 00:18:03] They're worried about the money that can be made
[00:18:03 --> 00:18:04] in the ego and the power of it.
[00:18:04 --> 00:18:07] It goes back to kind of what I said in that ARC speech,
[00:18:07 --> 00:18:08] about lack of leadership.
[00:18:08 --> 00:18:11] I just see that like, if we had people in big cities
[00:18:11 --> 00:18:14] or in small Appalachian towns that had like a real backbone
[00:18:14 --> 00:18:17] to them and like, and they were in a real position
[00:18:17 --> 00:18:19] of like leadership where they wanted to fix things,
[00:18:19 --> 00:18:21] that a lot of that stuff would get addressed and covered,
[00:18:21 --> 00:18:23] but we just don't have the right people in power,
[00:18:23 --> 00:18:26] maybe even just what it is, even in people don't say government.
[00:18:26 --> 00:18:28] The right people don't run.
[00:18:28 --> 00:18:29] They don't want that job, man.
[00:18:29 --> 00:18:30] They don't want that smoke.
[00:18:30 --> 00:18:31] They don't want people attacking them.
[00:18:31 --> 00:18:33] They don't want any of it.
[00:18:33 --> 00:18:35] The right people are the people that don't want to be president.
[00:18:35 --> 00:18:38] It's almost, it's almost like they've made these positions
[00:18:38 --> 00:18:39] only appealing to people who are like,
[00:18:39 --> 00:18:42] sort of criminal, associate pass their criminals.
[00:18:42 --> 00:18:43] Yeah, real, real.
[00:18:43 --> 00:18:45] Like who the fuck wants to run everything?
[00:18:45 --> 00:18:47] Do you gotta be crazy?
[00:18:47 --> 00:18:49] I don't even like running my whole house.
[00:18:49 --> 00:18:50] I don't like having employees.
[00:18:50 --> 00:18:52] It's too much, it's too much responsible.
[00:18:52 --> 00:18:54] What do you think would happen if just some normal people
[00:18:54 --> 00:18:56] ran the country, though, like just some average?
[00:18:56 --> 00:18:58] Just like, what if me and you just went and ran the,
[00:18:58 --> 00:19:00] would of me if you ran for president, what would happen?
[00:19:00 --> 00:19:03] If you killed, would you put in a fucking good vertical?
[00:19:03 --> 00:19:05] They would definitely be able to hit my big head.
[00:19:05 --> 00:19:06] That's for sure.
[00:19:06 --> 00:19:07] My head's not that little either.
[00:19:07 --> 00:19:09] You want a cigar?
[00:19:09 --> 00:19:10] Yeah, let's do it.
[00:19:10 --> 00:19:11] Get on that big dog.
[00:19:11 --> 00:19:13] Well, the, I smoked a cigar with a guy one time.
[00:19:13 --> 00:19:17] That, what happened?
[00:19:17 --> 00:19:18] This is the second one.
[00:19:18 --> 00:19:19] It ended up all on the internet.
[00:19:19 --> 00:19:20] Yeah.
[00:19:20 --> 00:19:22] This is your second cigar ever?
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:22] Yeah.
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:24] I was keeping it running for a minute.
[00:19:24 --> 00:19:26] Yeah, I was just pulling it.
[00:19:26 --> 00:19:29] The real cigar guys, they want you to do that first.
[00:19:29 --> 00:19:31] You kind of baked the outside.
[00:19:31 --> 00:19:35] I think they like it's a, like I'm in high school and it's like a fat joint.
[00:19:35 --> 00:19:37] Oh, imagine joint like this.
[00:19:37 --> 00:19:42] I'm guaranteed to do some people out there, some rappers rolling, blunts this thing.
[00:19:42 --> 00:19:46] You got to do it this way, are they getting mad at you?
[00:19:46 --> 00:19:48] Yeah, this is really good.
[00:19:48 --> 00:19:49] Yeah.
[00:19:49 --> 00:19:53] With how much your privacy is being vaded online, VPNs are no longer just a nice
[00:19:53 --> 00:19:54] thing to have.
[00:19:54 --> 00:19:56] It's a necessity.
[00:19:56 --> 00:19:59] Some people think, I don't need a VPN because I have nothing to hide.
[00:19:59 --> 00:20:03] But that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:00 --> 00:20:05] Actual data brokers want you to think because their profits depend on you, having nothing
[00:20:05 --> 00:20:06] to hide.
[00:20:06 --> 00:20:10] What you do online is your business, and if you want to keep your business, you need
[00:20:10 --> 00:20:12] ExpressVPN.
[00:20:12 --> 00:20:16] With ExpressVPN, a hundred percent of your online activity travels through secure encrypted
[00:20:16 --> 00:20:17] servers.
[00:20:17 --> 00:20:23] It hides your IP address, so no one can use it to track and sell your online activity.
[00:20:23 --> 00:20:25] And your privacy is restored.
[00:20:25 --> 00:20:30] ExpressVPN is also a great tool to secure your sensitive information from hackers.
[00:20:30 --> 00:20:35] If you're using public Wi-Fi, like a hotel, airport, or coffee shop, anyone can

[00:21:07 --> 00:21:09] Shout out to foundation cigars.
[00:21:09 --> 00:21:14] Well, hey, I did smoke a smoke, tap a block, a block in mild with Chris Davis and from
[00:21:14 --> 00:21:15] the Davis and Brothers.
[00:21:15 --> 00:21:16] Well, we're on time.
[00:21:16 --> 00:21:18] So I guess that counts as a cigar.
[00:21:18 --> 00:21:19] Kind of a cigar.
[00:21:19 --> 00:21:23] We're going to switch your sweets, they kind of count as cigars.
[00:21:23 --> 00:21:25] I have a talking about swishers sweets.
[00:21:25 --> 00:21:29] I have a friend of mine that I ride side by side with a lot named Jeremy.
[00:21:29 --> 00:21:31] And that's all he smokes or swishers sweets.
[00:21:31 --> 00:21:35] And that's like, is anytime I see him, I'm like, yo, what's up, swishers sweet?
[00:21:35 --> 00:21:38] So I ended up hitting him up on Instagram, swishers sweet.
[00:21:38 --> 00:21:40] And I said, hey, I got a friend of mine.
[00:21:40 --> 00:21:42] I was like, well, you just sent him some merchants.
[00:21:42 --> 00:21:46] And they totally did, like, he got this whole, he got like all these shirts and hats.
[00:21:46 --> 00:21:49] And so he's the only guy I know that smokes them, but he's like all day smoking them.
[00:21:49 --> 00:21:51] He's a, he was in the Marines and stuff.
[00:21:51 --> 00:21:52] And he's out now.
[00:21:52 --> 00:21:56] Just like rides a boat around all day and hangs, he's like, let's just dream life now.
[00:21:56 --> 00:21:57] And smoke swishers sweets.
[00:21:57 --> 00:22:00] So I wonder what percentage of swishers sweets get sliced open for blunts?
[00:22:02 --> 00:22:04] It's got to be 50, right?
[00:22:04 --> 00:22:05] Jamie higher.
[00:22:06 --> 00:22:07] 60% of it.
[00:22:07 --> 00:22:09] So like five or 75%.
[00:22:10 --> 00:22:13] Jeremy's the only guy I know who really smokes them without putting weed in him or anything.
[00:22:13 --> 00:22:15] He's like, he's like some, yeah.
[00:22:16 --> 00:22:17] Is he inhaled them?
[00:22:17 --> 00:22:18] Yeah, bro.
[00:22:19 --> 00:22:22] Ron White does that with them little tiny Ron White.
[00:22:22 --> 00:22:23] Those little tiny cigars.
[00:22:23 --> 00:22:24] But those things called again, Jamie.
[00:22:24 --> 00:22:25] We have a bunch of them.
[00:22:26 --> 00:22:27] Like, well, let's take a relos or something.
[00:22:27 --> 00:22:28] Yeah, he brought me a case of them.
[00:22:28 --> 00:22:31] Did I ever tell you their, my Ron White story?
[00:22:31 --> 00:22:32] No, I don't think so.
[00:22:32 --> 00:22:32] Did you?
[00:22:33 --> 00:22:34] I'm going to mess it all up, but that's okay.
[00:22:34 --> 00:22:37] Because that's what this is for is the messed stuff up.
[00:22:38 --> 00:22:42] So it was the night we recorded, gosh, you my head is like spinning out from this thing.
[00:22:42 --> 00:22:43] This is crazy.
[00:22:44 --> 00:22:47] The night that we recorded the day that we recorded the podcast that night.
[00:22:48 --> 00:22:52] There's only went to the mothership of the first time because Tom Sager invited me in.
[00:22:53 --> 00:22:58] So we're sitting in there in the green room, Ron White's there and Tom and a bunch
[00:22:58 --> 00:23:01] of people, William Montgomery, and I got to meet all these really cool people that night.
[00:23:01 --> 00:23:05] And so Tom was like, man, you ought to get up at the end of our set and do a couple songs.
[00:23:06 --> 00:23:08] And we only had one guitar.
[00:23:08 --> 00:23:12] And I really wanted my guitar, Joey, you know, the guy from the, he's in the scornful video, Joey Davis.
[00:23:12 --> 00:23:17] I wanted him to get up there and get to do it with me and Ron's like, well, I got a guitar in my house.
[00:23:17 --> 00:23:21] But, and dude, he's going to, he's supposed to be getting on stage to do a set.
[00:23:21 --> 00:23:23] Like, less than an hour, you know, 45 minutes.
[00:23:24 --> 00:23:32] So him and Joey get in his car and they run every red light from his house and back and go and get Ron White's guitar.
[00:23:32 --> 00:23:33] And that's what we use for our second.
[00:23:33 --> 00:23:35] 15 minutes away. That was such a risky move.
[00:23:36 --> 00:23:38] Yeah, like he said they flew there and back.
[00:23:38 --> 00:23:40] So you guys performed on stage at the mothership.
[00:23:40 --> 00:23:44] Those are the first time on musical acted ever performed there supposedly.
[00:23:44 --> 00:23:50] Yeah, 100% and except for back when it was a musical venue, I mean, Steve Ray Vaughn performed.
[00:23:50 --> 00:23:54] You saw the photos that we have in the tunnel, Steve Ray Vaughn performing there.
[00:23:54 --> 00:23:56] I think it was 83. He was there.
[00:23:56 --> 00:24:03] I think if, I think even by the end of this weekend, we will be able to really have a good blueprint for sound in there again.
[00:24:03 --> 00:24:10] Like, it's a, it's a small room, but I think it would just sound, you could really have an immersive listen and space for people to like.
[00:24:11 --> 00:24:13] Just such a cool spot that maybe do music now.
[00:24:13 --> 00:24:14] Oh, yeah.
[00:24:14 --> 00:24:16] No, I think it would be a great spot to do music.
[00:24:16 --> 00:24:20] It's just, we're always packed with comedians.
[00:24:20 --> 00:24:21] You know, we don't we do it for someone like you for a while.
[00:24:21 --> 00:24:24] It could be a lot, yeah, it could be like every once in a while.
[00:24:24 --> 00:24:27] Like, I love the idea of it doing it being like a live recorded thing.
[00:24:27 --> 00:24:33] Because my favorite music to listen to is the live version of almost anything, any way of people.
[00:24:33 --> 00:24:37] And it would be cool to go back and, I mean, our plan with this, we're going to record
[00:24:37 --> 00:24:46] We'll record Friday and Saturday night and my plan is to put out some kind of mothership live at the mothership and have some of the money go back to the Humane Society.
[00:24:46 --> 00:24:48] Oh, that's awesome.
[00:24:48 --> 00:24:55] That's being recorded and to see what happens, but even if we just get a couple songs out of it or something and put them out.
[00:24:55 --> 00:24:56] Oh, that's badass.
[00:24:56 --> 00:24:57] But yeah, I like that.
[00:24:57 --> 00:24:58] I really like the Austin Humane Society.
[00:24:58 --> 00:25:03] They, I was looking at all their, they got like some really funny dogs and stuff on there, too.
[00:25:03 --> 00:25:07] But I, I, I think it's cool getting to do some of them.
[00:25:07 --> 00:25:10] Yeah, I can't go to those places. I would have a hundred dogs.
[00:25:10 --> 00:25:12] They got this one dog on their website.
[00:25:12 --> 00:25:14] I should have, I should have sent it to you, but I don't know.
[00:25:14 --> 00:25:17] Maybe Jamie can find it, but it's like, there's this one like older dog.
[00:25:17 --> 00:25:19] I think he's at Chihuahua or something.
[00:25:19 --> 00:25:21] But he's got this real funny name like Buddy or Poppy or something.
[00:25:21 --> 00:25:23] But he's like the most like, he doesn't have any teeth.
[00:25:23 --> 00:25:24] His tongue's hanging out.
[00:25:24 --> 00:25:27] It's like, that's my, I could just take him home with me.
[00:25:27 --> 00:25:28] Buddy or something.
[00:25:28 --> 00:25:30] I've had a bunch of rescue dogs in my life.
[00:25:31 --> 00:25:33] Um, there's a thing.
[00:25:33 --> 00:25:34] There's like a relationship.
[00:25:34 --> 00:25:36] You have with them is different than in the other dog.
[00:25:36 --> 00:25:40] Like they fucking, they're so, they love you so much.
[00:25:40 --> 00:25:41] There's so happy rescue them.
[00:25:41 --> 00:25:44] Like they know that you rescued them.
[00:25:44 --> 00:25:46] Whereas my dog Marshall, he has no idea.
[00:25:46 --> 00:25:48] He's like living the best life.
[00:25:48 --> 00:25:49] He just like everyone's my friend.
[00:25:49 --> 00:25:50] Yeah.
[00:25:50 --> 00:25:53] He has, uh, he's never fucking growl that a person in his life.
[00:25:53 --> 00:25:55] He's nothing but sweet.
[00:25:55 --> 00:25:57] Think about how lucky you got to be to be Joe Rogan's dog.
[00:25:57 --> 00:25:58] That's pretty cool.
[00:25:58 --> 00:26:00] Like what's the odds that I don't have a dog?
[00:26:00 --> 00:26:01] It might have a dog like him.
[00:26:01 --> 00:26:02] Yeah.
[00:26:02 --> 00:26:03] He's the best dog ever.
[00:26:03 --> 00:26:05] Yeah, no, he's like a little human.
[00:26:05 --> 00:26:06] He's like a human.
[00:26:06 --> 00:26:07] Like we have conversations.
[00:26:07 --> 00:26:10] Like he knows like not just words.
[00:26:10 --> 00:26:14] He knows like when I'm saying something like what to do.
[00:26:14 --> 00:26:17] Like he, me and that dog are like blocked in.
[00:26:17 --> 00:26:18] It's wild.
[00:26:18 --> 00:26:19] He's the best.
[00:26:19 --> 00:26:23] He's just all love, like for everybody that comes over.
[00:26:23 --> 00:26:25] Like when people come over the studio and he's here,
[00:26:25 --> 00:26:26] he just does a circle.
[00:26:26 --> 00:26:28] He's like, I'm your friend.
[00:26:28 --> 00:26:30] Then it looks like I'm your friend.
[00:26:30 --> 00:26:32] It just goes around and he sees you.
[00:26:32 --> 00:26:34] The first thing he does is flop on his back.
[00:26:34 --> 00:26:36] I know you want to rub my belly.
[00:26:36 --> 00:26:37] Come on.
[00:26:37 --> 00:26:37] Yeah.
[00:26:38 --> 00:26:41] He's just so used to be and just loved dogs.
[00:26:41 --> 00:26:46] Yeah, I just got a, um, why had, you know, I had the three, I had three dogs.
[00:26:46 --> 00:26:48] And then I lost my white shepherd.
[00:26:48 --> 00:26:50] Like right after we got off a tour, he got bone cancer.
[00:26:50 --> 00:26:53] And he was gone within like a month or a month and a half.
[00:26:53 --> 00:26:55] No, it was a really important thing that we should probably tell people about right now.
[00:26:55 --> 00:26:57] And we're talking about cancer.
[00:26:57 --> 00:26:59] Stop feeding your dog process food.
[00:26:59 --> 00:27:01] I know it's expensive.
[00:27:01 --> 00:27:04] But if you can get it, get yourself your dog real food.
[00:27:04 --> 00:27:07] There's companies like farmers dog.
[00:27:07 --> 00:27:09] That's what you use, right?
[00:27:09 --> 00:27:10] Farmers dog.
[00:27:10 --> 00:27:15] And they'll send you like real food and you feed your dog real food.
[00:27:15 --> 00:27:19] It's like real human grade meat and vegetables.
[00:27:19 --> 00:27:20] Your dog will be way better off.
[00:27:20 --> 00:27:22] Just like you would be way better off.
[00:27:22 --> 00:27:27] Anything that can sit on a shelf for six months and not rot.
[00:27:27 --> 00:27:28] It's not good for you.
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:28] Yeah.
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:30] It just sustains them, you know.
[00:27:30 --> 00:27:35] And then, you know, obviously your dogs are running around drinking out of puddles.
[00:27:35 --> 00:27:38] And, you know, what fucking toxins they're exposed?
[00:27:38 --> 00:27:38] I need a lot.
[00:27:38 --> 00:27:41] Like horseshit and stuff, too, they're obsessed with your food.
[00:27:41 --> 00:27:44] But you're going to get a healthier dog if you feed them real food.
[00:27:44 --> 00:27:45] That's all I'm saying.
[00:27:45 --> 00:27:49] I'm not saying it's secured to all it is, but man, it fixed my dog quick.
[00:27:49 --> 00:27:52] Marshall was starting to get a little chubby and we're trying to lessen his food.
[00:27:52 --> 00:27:55] But he was always hungry and I was like this sucks.
[00:27:55 --> 00:28:00] And then we found out the company that I'm using is Maeve, M-A-E-V.
[00:28:00 --> 00:28:03] And they sell you frozen food and he eats it frozen.
[00:28:03 --> 00:28:07] And it's just me and vegetables and he's like fucking loves it.
[00:28:07 --> 00:28:13] And he gobbles it up and he lost the body weight, his coat looked better, he had way more energy.
[00:28:13 --> 00:28:18] I'm like, of course, he's eating real food instead of eating some processed bullshit that's
[00:28:18 --> 00:28:19] filled with preservatives.
[00:28:19 --> 00:28:21] You could sit on a fucking shelf for it.
[00:28:21 --> 00:28:25] Like, if you only ate protein bars all day,
[00:28:25 --> 00:28:28] long and nothing but protein bars, he'd probably get sick.
[00:28:28 --> 00:28:30] How was that thing just sitting there?
[00:28:30 --> 00:28:33] Like, how can you just live off it?
[00:28:33 --> 00:28:35] Plus you got to get tired eating the same thing every day.
[00:28:35 --> 00:28:37] Yeah, that too.
[00:28:37 --> 00:28:38] Yeah.
[00:28:38 --> 00:28:41] Like at this point, I mean, I feel like for your dog, he might as well live a pretty cool life.
[00:28:42 --> 00:28:44] He's got, you know, he's Joe Rogan's dog.
[00:28:44 --> 00:28:47] He can't just be in regular dog food anymore.
[00:28:47 --> 00:28:48] I uh, people don't know though.
[00:28:48 --> 00:28:50] They think dog food is what you give dogs.
[00:28:50 --> 00:28:51] That's the problem.
[00:28:51 --> 00:28:56] Like, they need to understand, like, dogs are just like any other animal, like human beings.
[00:28:57 --> 00:29:01] What they eat has a giant effect on their overall physical health.
[00:29:01 --> 00:29:02] Yeah.
[00:29:02 --> 00:29:05] Yeah, I've been feeding my eggs.
[00:29:05 --> 00:29:07] We've got a bunch of land birds now in meat birds.
[00:29:07 --> 00:29:08] Oh, that's nice.
[00:29:08 --> 00:29:09] But they'll, they just eat raw eggs.
[00:29:09 --> 00:29:13] How long do your meat birds live before you whack them?
[00:29:15 --> 00:29:20] So we just, I just, I've got some now that are about two weeks old and they'll be gone,
[00:29:21 --> 00:29:23] they'll be gone before it starts to cool off.
[00:29:23 --> 00:29:23] It's quick.
[00:29:25 --> 00:29:28] I want to say like two and a half months with them.
[00:29:28 --> 00:29:30] They get, they get to the point where they get so fat.
[00:29:30 --> 00:29:32] They actually can't hold themselves up anymore.
[00:29:32 --> 00:29:33] That is so crazy.
[00:29:33 --> 00:29:34] Yeah.
[00:29:34 --> 00:29:35] Because I don't have meat birds.
[00:29:35 --> 00:29:36] I have egg laying hands.
[00:29:36 --> 00:29:38] And these little ladies just run around all day long.
[00:29:38 --> 00:29:40] You just run around your own loose.
[00:29:40 --> 00:29:40] Yeah.
[00:29:40 --> 00:29:43] My mom, my mom, my, my, my, my, yeah.
[00:29:43 --> 00:29:47] Yeah, I do, I do the chicken tractors, but then I will let them out during the day,
[00:29:47 --> 00:29:48] some two just so they can run around.
[00:29:48 --> 00:29:49] Yeah.
[00:29:49 --> 00:29:51] It's good for them, makes the eggs healthier.
[00:29:51 --> 00:29:52] But they're hilarious to watch too.
[00:29:52 --> 00:29:53] They're just great.
[00:29:53 --> 00:29:57] My friend who runs, uh, he, he has, uh, meat ones.
[00:29:57 --> 00:29:59] And he said, he waits until their legs break.
[00:30:00 --> 00:30:01] And I go, what?
[00:30:01 --> 00:30:03] He goes, they get so big that they're legs break
[00:30:03 --> 00:30:04] and that's killing them.
[00:30:04 --> 00:30:06] I'm like, Jesus Christ.
[00:30:06 --> 00:30:08] What did we do to these fucking chickens?
[00:30:08 --> 00:30:10] It's kind of sick, yeah.
[00:30:10 --> 00:30:11] It is totally sick.
[00:30:11 --> 00:30:13] Because I'm seeing my chickens that are years old
[00:30:13 --> 00:30:14] just running around.
[00:30:14 --> 00:30:18] And this fucking chickens get to be two months old
[00:30:18 --> 00:30:21] and they're legs break from the way to their bodies.
[00:30:21 --> 00:30:22] Yeah.
[00:30:22 --> 00:30:23] Yeah, it's kind of depressing.
[00:30:23 --> 00:30:24] But that's why, at least in their short life,
[00:30:24 --> 00:30:27] I tried to let them have, I let them get us some sunshine
[00:30:27 --> 00:30:29] and run around and read stories to them
[00:30:29 --> 00:30:30] and all that.
[00:30:30 --> 00:30:31] That way, it's not so bad.
[00:30:31 --> 00:30:33] That way, it doesn't feel like I'm just like a horrible dictate.
[00:30:33 --> 00:30:34] Like a chicken dictators.
[00:30:34 --> 00:30:38] The amount of chickens that get whacked in this country
[00:30:38 --> 00:30:39] every year is crazy.
[00:30:39 --> 00:30:42] Yeah, and honestly, raising birds in your yard is so much better than
[00:30:42 --> 00:30:45] so much fun from Tyson or something like that.
[00:30:45 --> 00:30:49] Oh, so that's a regular chicken on the left from 1957.
[00:30:49 --> 00:30:54] And then in the time 1978 rolled around, we got a pretty fat.
[00:30:54 --> 00:30:56] It kind of looks like it just looks kind of like what happened
[00:30:56 --> 00:30:59] with all of us from then from back until now.
[00:30:59 --> 00:31:03] And you know, probably no coincidence.
[00:31:03 --> 00:31:04] We're all eating terrible food too.
[00:31:04 --> 00:31:07] But I think there's something going on with their genetics too.
[00:31:07 --> 00:31:09] I think they look at that thing.
[00:31:09 --> 00:31:10] That's crazy.
[00:31:10 --> 00:31:11] Look at size that butterball.
[00:31:11 --> 00:31:14] Yeah, that looks like a fucking soccer ball.
[00:31:14 --> 00:31:15] And they're nuts.
[00:31:15 --> 00:31:16] That's nuts.
[00:31:16 --> 00:31:17] That's a chicken.
[00:31:17 --> 00:31:18] That is fucking insane.
[00:31:18 --> 00:31:21] Look at that one sitting there in a ball.
[00:31:21 --> 00:31:22] Look at that one that's in a ball.
[00:31:22 --> 00:31:23] Look at that.
[00:31:23 --> 00:31:25] That is bananas.
[00:31:25 --> 00:31:26] Wow.
[00:31:26 --> 00:31:27] They're still my favorite.
[00:31:27 --> 00:31:28] I've tried so far.
[00:31:28 --> 00:31:29] I've tried.
[00:31:29 --> 00:31:32] I do guinea birds, turkeys and we've tried to try to feed
[00:31:32 --> 00:31:36] different types of chickens and stuff, but turkeys overrated.
[00:31:36 --> 00:31:37] Turkeys good.
[00:31:37 --> 00:31:38] They're funny.
[00:31:38 --> 00:31:39] Oh, yeah.
[00:31:39 --> 00:31:40] They're probably in the right.
[00:31:40 --> 00:31:41] But they're really funny in person.
[00:31:41 --> 00:31:42] They're good.
[00:31:42 --> 00:31:44] They're good to eat if you eat them right after you get them out of the oven.
[00:31:44 --> 00:31:47] Or if it's going to be on the sandwich with a bunch of other shit on it.
[00:31:47 --> 00:31:49] Otherwise they're dry and boring.
[00:31:49 --> 00:31:50] It's a weird bird.
[00:31:50 --> 00:31:55] It's a bird that like somehow or another, it became our holiday bird.
[00:31:56 --> 00:31:57] Very strange.
[00:31:57 --> 00:31:59] They make this real gutteral noise.
[00:31:59 --> 00:32:02] It's like a vibration more than a noise.
[00:32:02 --> 00:32:04] But the males, they have this crazy.
[00:32:04 --> 00:32:06] I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:32:06 --> 00:32:10] But it's a noise they make internally that you can hear.
[00:32:10 --> 00:32:12] It sounds like a UFO.
[00:32:12 --> 00:32:16] It sounds like when you're getting sucked up in a UFO or it's just crazy.
[00:32:16 --> 00:32:17] No, it's like that.
[00:32:17 --> 00:32:18] Oh, really?
[00:32:18 --> 00:32:19] But they're like dogs to me.
[00:32:19 --> 00:32:21] I've got a couple of Timmy and Tommy.
[00:32:21 --> 00:32:22] They run out.
[00:32:22 --> 00:32:24] Yeah, well, I did.
[00:32:24 --> 00:32:28] Now, Timmy's in the freezer, but we still got it.
[00:32:28 --> 00:32:29] We still got Tommy.
[00:32:29 --> 00:32:31] So Tommy's still your friend.
[00:32:31 --> 00:32:33] Timmy.
[00:32:33 --> 00:32:36] Break through on the birds to investigate it in a gene.
[00:32:36 --> 00:32:37] Ah, there it is.
[00:32:37 --> 00:32:42] That played a key role came in 2010 with a study of the genomes of eight different populations
[00:32:42 --> 00:32:43] of present-day chickens.
[00:32:43 --> 00:32:48] From around the world, researchers found they all carry two copies of one version of a gene called
[00:32:48 --> 00:32:53] the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, which apparently set in motion changes that
[00:32:53 --> 00:32:54] jumped up the birds.
[00:32:54 --> 00:33:00] This dominant version of the gene or allele had swept through all the domesticated chickens
[00:33:00 --> 00:33:05] regardless of whether they were boilers, boilers rather bread for size or strains, bread
[00:33:05 --> 00:33:09] for laying many eggs, although the precise function of the gene is not known at regulates
[00:33:09 --> 00:33:11] metabolism reproduction.
[00:33:11 --> 00:33:14] So probably stimulated chickens to lay more eggs you're around.
[00:33:14 --> 00:33:16] So the big ass chickens at lay more eggs.
[00:33:16 --> 00:33:20] Let's start off from a decree from a pope a thousand years ago.
[00:33:20 --> 00:33:21] Whoa.
[00:33:21 --> 00:33:25] How did one ban on four-legged animals?
[00:33:25 --> 00:33:26] What?
[00:33:26 --> 00:33:27] Yeah.
[00:33:27 --> 00:33:31] They got tough and banned meat from four-legged animals on fasts.
[00:33:31 --> 00:33:32] Oh, on fasts.
[00:33:32 --> 00:33:34] Which number to 130 days out of the old?
[00:33:34 --> 00:33:35] Tim.
[00:33:35 --> 00:33:36] 130 fasts?
[00:33:36 --> 00:33:38] What were they doing back then?
[00:33:38 --> 00:33:41] Yeah, you couldn't eat, like, get the fasts of all of lent, which is 40 days.
[00:33:41 --> 00:33:43] That's like the Christmas Easter fast.
[00:33:43 --> 00:33:45] You probably had to do it again now around Christmas.
[00:33:45 --> 00:33:48] But when they say fast, but you could eat chicken?
[00:33:48 --> 00:33:50] Yeah, they don't have fast or fish.
[00:33:51 --> 00:33:52] That's bullshit.
[00:33:52 --> 00:33:54] Yeah, the lent thing when I was a kid.
[00:33:54 --> 00:33:55] I remember that.
[00:33:55 --> 00:33:56] I don't know.
[00:33:56 --> 00:33:57] I can't shoot on Friday.
[00:33:57 --> 00:33:59] I don't think that the Catholic Church...
[00:33:59 --> 00:34:02] I just can't imagine the Catholic Church ever come out with some kind of decree.
[00:34:02 --> 00:34:04] They just doesn't make total sense though.
[00:34:04 --> 00:34:05] You know, everybody had to follow.
[00:34:05 --> 00:34:06] I don't remember.
[00:34:06 --> 00:34:08] I'm sure it's some... I'm sure there's some...
[00:34:08 --> 00:34:09] Yeah, forever.
[00:34:09 --> 00:34:11] I'm sure there's some reasonable explanation.
[00:34:11 --> 00:34:13] Yeah, they definitely have a dialed in.
[00:34:13 --> 00:34:15] Yeah, it's not like church it's a thousand years ago.
[00:34:15 --> 00:34:17] Would ever do anything they didn't make a lot of sense.
[00:34:17 --> 00:34:22] Well, I think back then, when did they stop being allowed to have wives and shit?
[00:34:22 --> 00:34:24] When did that happen?
[00:34:24 --> 00:34:26] Like when did the Catholic Church put a band?
[00:34:26 --> 00:34:29] Like when did they make it so that everybody had to be celibate?
[00:34:29 --> 00:34:32] Boy, what a stupid idea that was.
[00:34:32 --> 00:34:36] You want to get people completely disconnected from society
[00:34:36 --> 00:34:39] and sexually insanely repressed.
[00:34:39 --> 00:34:43] Just you give them salt, Peter, and tell them they can't beat off.
[00:34:43 --> 00:34:47] It became canon law and 11th century later reinforced
[00:34:47 --> 00:34:49] and the Council of Trent 1545.
[00:34:49 --> 00:34:53] So, but there was something to 340 years of a little slippery times.
[00:34:53 --> 00:34:54] What do you think?
[00:34:54 --> 00:34:57] This episode is brought to you by Mossachips.
[00:34:57 --> 00:35:02] Did you know that all chips used to be cooked in Talo up until the 90s
[00:35:02 --> 00:35:06] when big corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils?
[00:35:06 --> 00:35:12] And today, seed oils make up 20% of the average American's daily calories.
[00:35:12 --> 00:35:15] Well, Mossachips decided to do something about it.
[00:35:15 --> 00:35:20] They created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just 3 ingredients and no seed oils.
[00:35:20 --> 00:35:27] Just organic, mixed, tamalized corn, sea salt, and 100% grass-fed beef tallow.
[00:35:27 --> 00:35:31] Mossachips is beloved by tens of thousands of customers, including me.
[00:35:31 --> 00:35:33] I buy them. They're awesome.
[00:35:33 --> 00:35:37] They've been endorsed by leading health and nutrition experts like Ben Greenfield
[00:35:37 --> 00:35:40] and Gary Breko, who have appeared on this show as well.
[00:35:40 --> 00:35:44] Ready to give Mossachips, go to Mossachips.com slash JRE
[00:35:44 --> 00:35:49] and use the code JRE for 25% off your first order.
[00:35:49 --> 00:35:52] Ultimately, what is the mode? It's all control, obviously,
[00:35:52 --> 00:35:57] but it's crazy to think about all the things that the church, at one point in time,
[00:35:57 --> 00:35:59] the church was almost like the power structure.
[00:35:59 --> 00:36:02] They were like the government for a long time.
[00:36:02 --> 00:36:03] Yeah, for a long time.
[00:36:03 --> 00:36:06] Yeah, I mean, that immense power.
[00:36:06 --> 00:36:11] The pope would decide whether or not armies were going to be set places.
[00:36:11 --> 00:36:12] Yeah.
[00:36:12 --> 00:36:13] nuts.
[00:36:13 --> 00:36:14] Yeah.
[00:36:14 --> 00:36:16] And if you look at the Vatican, you go, oh, that's what you guys did.
[00:36:16 --> 00:36:18] If I can stall everybody's art.
[00:36:18 --> 00:36:21] They have so much art, like how did you get this?
[00:36:21 --> 00:36:24] How did you get billions of dollars in art?
[00:36:24 --> 00:36:25] I mean, it's kind of cool.
[00:36:25 --> 00:36:28] It's the fact that it's there and you can visit it.
[00:36:28 --> 00:36:29] And you should visit it.
[00:36:29 --> 00:36:32] If you've never been to the Vatican, it's fucking bananas.
[00:36:32 --> 00:36:36] In a way, it's like there's always been somebody trying to use a moral high ground
[00:36:36 --> 00:36:37] to control other people.
[00:36:37 --> 00:36:40] Like now it's the opposite, right? It's like now it's people.
[00:36:40 --> 00:36:44] Now it's like the people opposite of church that are sort of like trying to control
[00:36:44 --> 00:36:47] people through this moral authority of like this is what's writing.
[00:36:47 --> 00:36:50] Like this sort of new society that we have to live in where everything has to be
[00:36:50 --> 00:36:54] comfortable and nobody's allowed to be offended and we're not, and it's like all this.
[00:36:54 --> 00:36:58] That's like the same authoritarian psychology that was in the old church.
[00:36:58 --> 00:37:02] This is the moral, you have to follow this because it's the moral high ground.
[00:37:02 --> 00:37:03] You're not allowed to speak.
[00:37:03 --> 00:37:07] It's like it's always somebody trying to control somebody else with this virtuous
[00:37:07 --> 00:37:09] bunch of propaganda.
[00:37:09 --> 00:37:13] And yeah, it's like I was talking, you know, I cut most of the people on my team.
[00:37:13 --> 00:37:17] I say most, there's only really four of us now like in my music business,
[00:37:17 --> 00:37:21] but two of them are from Ireland and my tour manager was telling me about like
[00:37:21 --> 00:37:25] growing up and growing up in Dublin when he was younger.
[00:37:25 --> 00:37:32] I guess like back in the 70s or 80s and the like just just the stigma within the church
[00:37:32 --> 00:37:37] and all the like so much stuff that the church was doing wrong that would get kind of covered
[00:37:37 --> 00:37:41] up and brushed to the side and it's just it's really crazy when you read into all that.
[00:37:41 --> 00:37:43] Like how much corruption existed back then.
[00:37:43 --> 00:37:48] You know, it's like now it's now it's easy to point to corruption and government and
[00:37:48 --> 00:37:52] society and everything else, but it's not like the church is more dead now than it
[00:37:52 --> 00:37:53] is corrupt.
[00:37:53 --> 00:37:56] That's say the back then it was just like this power hungry thing.
[00:37:56 --> 00:37:58] And that to me, that's not real church.
[00:37:58 --> 00:38:03] That's just like I said, that's just government or regime, even church as a, you know, using God
[00:38:03 --> 00:38:04] as a way to control people.
[00:38:04 --> 00:38:07] But it's a lot different than what church should be or could be.
[00:38:07 --> 00:38:08] For sure.
[00:38:08 --> 00:38:12] I mean, that's, that's just a function of human beings when they get in power.
[00:38:12 --> 00:38:15] Human beings when they get in power, they want more power.
[00:38:15 --> 00:38:21] Like if you're in the automobile business and you're making cars, you want to make more cars.
[00:38:21 --> 00:38:22] Want to make more cars.
[00:38:22 --> 00:38:23] Want to sell more cars.
[00:38:23 --> 00:38:24] Yeah.
[00:38:24 --> 00:38:25] Got to sell more cars.
[00:38:25 --> 00:38:26] If I'm in the power business, I want more power.
[00:38:26 --> 00:38:27] I don't want this amount of power.
[00:38:27 --> 00:38:28] I want more cars.
[00:38:28 --> 00:38:30] These people are trying to take my power away.
[00:38:30 --> 00:38:31] I want extra power.
[00:38:31 --> 00:38:34] The best way to keep them from taking my power way is to get more power and get it so
[00:38:34 --> 00:38:36] that they can never take my power away.
[00:38:36 --> 00:38:38] You know, lock it down, make the elections bullshit.
[00:38:38 --> 00:38:39] You know, make it like Russia.
[00:38:39 --> 00:38:40] Hey, Putin won again.
[00:38:40 --> 00:38:41] Everybody clap.
[00:38:41 --> 00:38:47] Did you see that video that went around recently of, I think it was in Romania, but there
[00:38:47 --> 00:38:49] was like a overthrow that happened in a day.
[00:38:49 --> 00:38:50] It was like that.
[00:38:50 --> 00:38:52] It was from back in the 80s.
[00:38:52 --> 00:38:57] It was, I think it was like a, it was a dictator that it was over Romania, I believe.
[00:38:57 --> 00:38:58] I don't know.
[00:38:58 --> 00:39:02] I'm not on the internet a whole lot anymore, thankfully.
[00:39:02 --> 00:39:07] But I remember watching a bit of this video where this is like a Romanian dictator who had
[00:39:07 --> 00:39:11] he had been in power for like 20 years and had done a lot of oppressive stuff.
[00:39:11 --> 00:39:13] But overall was like maintaining power.
[00:39:13 --> 00:39:17] And then at some point a police officer or a military official or something shot,
[00:39:17 --> 00:39:23] I think like a, like a preacher or a pope or something in the, the dictator dude took the
[00:39:23 --> 00:39:27] side of the police and it sort of was like a cultural shift and basically like he went
[00:39:27 --> 00:39:31] to give this big speech and all these people showed up and they had a pause playing
[00:39:31 --> 00:39:34] over loud speakers, but really the crowd was there to like mob.
[00:39:34 --> 00:39:38] And within like a day they had like taken the whole government over the whole military
[00:39:38 --> 00:39:39] turned against them.
[00:39:39 --> 00:39:41] It was a big video that just got uploaded about it.
[00:39:41 --> 00:39:44] Like maybe a month ago, I think it was Romania, I believe.
[00:39:44 --> 00:39:48] But it was so quick, it was like he went from being in this position of power and like
[00:39:48 --> 00:39:52] ruling over everything and having just just extreme wealth and the whole military
[00:39:52 --> 00:39:57] at his disposal to everyone turning on him and he was publicly executed.
[00:39:57 --> 00:40:00] I think the day after that speech, but that was just something I watched.
[00:40:00 --> 00:40:05] Here we go. Yeah, executing a dictator, open wounds of Romania's Christmas Revolution.
[00:40:05 --> 00:40:07] Wow, they did it on Christmas.
[00:40:07 --> 00:40:08] Damn.
[00:40:08 --> 00:40:10] Damn.
[00:40:10 --> 00:40:11] Wow.
[00:40:11 --> 00:40:13] And there's a video on this?
[00:40:13 --> 00:40:17] Yeah, there's a video on YouTube that somebody sent me that I was watching through.
[00:40:17 --> 00:40:18] It just showed out.
[00:40:18 --> 00:40:23] It just showed though, going back to like if enough people have their minds made the same way.
[00:40:23 --> 00:40:25] They can just pretty much do anything.
[00:40:25 --> 00:40:26] Wow.
[00:40:26 --> 00:40:29] But I believe it was within like a two day period.
[00:40:29 --> 00:40:30] That all this happened.
[00:40:30 --> 00:40:33] He went from being empowered to being publicly executed.
[00:40:33 --> 00:40:37] And they held up elections afterwards and like, and I don't know all the history of it.
[00:40:37 --> 00:40:40] I know very little, but it's just something that seemed really interesting to me that I've never,
[00:40:40 --> 00:40:43] I was never taught this in school or anything.
[00:40:43 --> 00:40:44] I know that.
[00:40:44 --> 00:40:46] But of course I didn't pay a whole lot of attention while I was there either.
[00:40:46 --> 00:40:48] So maybe I did get taught.
[00:40:48 --> 00:40:49] I don't know.
[00:40:49 --> 00:40:53] There's been so much war in that part of the world, man, for so long, for so long.
[00:40:53 --> 00:40:56] It's like baked into the ground.
[00:40:57 --> 00:40:59] The crazy shit that's going on in Ukraine right now,
[00:40:59 --> 00:41:03] you've seen that they, they're flying these drones that you can't jam.
[00:41:03 --> 00:41:08] And the way they are, they have like miles of fiber optic cable attached to them.
[00:41:08 --> 00:41:09] Yeah.
[00:41:09 --> 00:41:10] This is so crazy.
[00:41:10 --> 00:41:12] They're like fishing, they're like fishing with a drone.
[00:41:12 --> 00:41:16] And now birds are making like nests of this fiber optic stuff.
[00:41:16 --> 00:41:18] They're picking it up like, I was perfect.
[00:41:18 --> 00:41:20] Make a little nest for this shit.
[00:41:20 --> 00:41:24] You see how they got the drones in for the attack on the planes recently?
[00:41:24 --> 00:41:25] What did they do?
[00:41:25 --> 00:41:26] They drove them in trucks, right?
[00:41:26 --> 00:41:27] Yeah.
[00:41:27 --> 00:41:29] They were like, I don't know what buried is the right word,
[00:41:29 --> 00:41:31] but they were like secretly in the trucks.
[00:41:31 --> 00:41:33] And then like they all came out at once or something.
[00:41:33 --> 00:41:34] Yeah.
[00:41:34 --> 00:41:36] You've soaped up of these like log cabins or something.
[00:41:36 --> 00:41:39] They all came out and they all went out and attacked over planes.
[00:41:39 --> 00:41:40] Sheds.
[00:41:40 --> 00:41:41] They were sheds loaded on the truck.
[00:41:41 --> 00:41:44] Well stuck around the fucking ingenious man.
[00:41:44 --> 00:41:47] And they sort of took like a year and a half to come up with this plan.
[00:41:47 --> 00:41:51] This will change your war for every forever though, I guess.
[00:41:51 --> 00:41:53] I mean, artificial intelligence will too.
[00:41:53 --> 00:41:55] I'm reading a book about it right now.
[00:41:55 --> 00:42:00] It's a fiction book, one of the gray man books.
[00:42:00 --> 00:42:06] That is specifically about using autonomous weapons.
[00:42:06 --> 00:42:10] It's the chaos agent by Mark Rainy.
[00:42:10 --> 00:42:19] It's about a guy who's this billionaire who develops this autonomous weapon's program.
[00:42:19 --> 00:42:20] But they're doing that.
[00:42:20 --> 00:42:22] They're doing that right now.
[00:42:22 --> 00:42:25] We don't know like how advanced China stuff is.
[00:42:25 --> 00:42:28] But we know their drones are insanely advanced.
[00:42:28 --> 00:42:30] Like their drone shows that they put on.
[00:42:30 --> 00:42:32] They just put on another one recently.
[00:42:32 --> 00:42:34] Like the largest ever drone show.
[00:42:34 --> 00:42:38] And you watch these coordinated things in the sky that are creating images.
[00:42:38 --> 00:42:41] And you're like that 100% could be a weapon.
[00:42:41 --> 00:42:42] Like that thing.
[00:42:42 --> 00:42:44] You can get that thing to be so precise.
[00:42:44 --> 00:42:45] They coordinate together.
[00:42:45 --> 00:42:48] All you have to do is like put a suicide drone.
[00:42:48 --> 00:42:50] Put like 30 of this thing.
[00:42:50 --> 00:42:51] Look at these things, bro.
[00:42:51 --> 00:42:53] These are drones.
[00:42:53 --> 00:42:55] And that's this.
[00:42:55 --> 00:42:58] I mean that is fucking bananas.
[00:42:58 --> 00:43:00] Look at that.
[00:43:00 --> 00:43:02] I mean it's crazy.
[00:43:02 --> 00:43:06] I've heard, you know, this is all just generalization stuff.
[00:43:06 --> 00:43:10] But I've definitely, I've heard people make pretty compelling arguments about like,
[00:43:10 --> 00:43:14] you know, all these sort of like prophetic visions of the end of times,
[00:43:14 --> 00:43:18] all the stuff in the sky and all the imagery and all that, that a lot of that could be.
[00:43:18 --> 00:43:25] I don't know, I just, I see a time coming very soon where the word warfare is conducted with these drones.
[00:43:25 --> 00:43:27] And also with like probably ground machinery too.
[00:43:27 --> 00:43:32] Like you see, they've got Tesla bots and other variants of that that are able to catch tennis balls and organize groceries.
[00:43:32 --> 00:43:37] And these things are all fed off of artificial intelligence, which knows everything about all of us collectively.
[00:43:37 --> 00:43:42] It sees where we go and what we do and what we say and what we shot for and what we look for and how we drive.
[00:43:42 --> 00:43:45] And it's like this almost like this very god-like thing.
[00:43:45 --> 00:43:50] And I don't think that it even matters who's AI it is if it's China or ours or some private company.
[00:43:50 --> 00:43:53] I think it's like at some point it will just be the thing.
[00:43:53 --> 00:43:55] It won't even be China's AI anymore.
[00:43:55 --> 00:43:56] It will just be.
[00:43:56 --> 00:43:58] Yeah, it'll say fuck you, China.
[00:43:58 --> 00:43:59] We're taking over.
[00:43:59 --> 00:44:00] We don't believe in countries.
[00:44:00 --> 00:44:02] We believe in the hive mind.
[00:44:02 --> 00:44:03] How do you stop that?
[00:44:03 --> 00:44:07] Like how do you, like it goes into industry and creativity.
[00:44:07 --> 00:44:11] And almost everything, almost everything that a human can provide.
[00:44:11 --> 00:44:16] Outside of very select few things can be emulated and replicated and done by it.
[00:44:16 --> 00:44:21] It makes us practically irrelevant in the eyes of in a lot of ways.
[00:44:21 --> 00:44:26] It doesn't make us irrelevant in art because you're always going to want art from a person.
[00:44:26 --> 00:44:28] You're always going to want art.
[00:44:28 --> 00:44:30] You're always going to want paintings from a real person.
[00:44:30 --> 00:44:32] You're always going to want music from a real person.
[00:44:32 --> 00:44:39] I don't know though, like I think with I think AI is already like deeply ingrained in music.
[00:44:39 --> 00:44:42] I don't think I can't.
[00:44:42 --> 00:44:43] I don't know.
[00:44:43 --> 00:44:50] I would bet I'd bet a lot that most of the new big songs, the big hot songs that get written and just the big.
[00:44:50 --> 00:44:52] I think AI drives all that.
[00:44:52 --> 00:44:56] I know for a short period of time I used a social media company in Nashville.
[00:44:56 --> 00:44:59] There was also a period of time that I used to manage the company in Nashville.
[00:44:59 --> 00:45:03] And both of those girls I worked with at both of those companies who were helping me with social media stuff.
[00:45:03 --> 00:45:06] They even had AI trying to write my captions and stuff.
[00:45:06 --> 00:45:09] And I would always just like it was always as much dumb sounding stuff.
[00:45:09 --> 00:45:14] But it was like if they would take pictures from after a show or something and they would want to make a post on Instagram.
[00:45:14 --> 00:45:17] The next day they said, oh, had so much fun in this town.
[00:45:17 --> 00:45:19] It was I'll never forget it.
[00:45:19 --> 00:45:20] Can't wait to see you next time.
[00:45:20 --> 00:45:22] And it was just like this little they had like a little thing.
[00:45:22 --> 00:45:26] But it it pre-wrote all these based off of like how I wrote in the past and stuff.
[00:45:26 --> 00:45:31] And it's weird how it goes back to what you said about most of what's on the internet isn't real anyway.
[00:45:31 --> 00:45:36] But I think in music AI is much more prevalent than we realize.
[00:45:36 --> 00:45:39] I just think it's like kept in the people aren't going to say that they're using it.
[00:45:39 --> 00:45:44] But I think like in the big these big songwriter circles and things where they have to generate.
[00:45:44 --> 00:45:47] You have to generate 20 or 30 songs a week and like there's all this pressure.
[00:45:47 --> 00:45:51] I mean like and that's your job and you're like, oh my god, what am I going to do?
[00:45:51 --> 00:45:54] Like you know like I can't go back and live with my pair.
[00:45:54 --> 00:45:55] I got to do I don't know.
[00:45:55 --> 00:45:59] I just I don't see how people aren't it's almost people use AI and almost every job now.
[00:45:59 --> 00:46:05] I know like people who are in sales who use it to help them manage their customer bases and who they're going to call on and what they're going to say.
[00:46:05 --> 00:46:09] I just I don't know. I think it will become I think it's already becoming green in us.
[00:46:09 --> 00:46:13] We're already so addicted that we're so reliant that technology is it's pitiful.
[00:46:13 --> 00:46:17] You know, just like how hard it is to walk around without a phone, you know.
[00:46:17 --> 00:46:24] Like we're integrated even even when I had periods of time where I knew I had months off and I would always at least.
[00:46:24 --> 00:46:31] I got to the point where I I ween myself down to like this I bought a flip phone from Walmart that still runs on a Verizon sim.
[00:46:31 --> 00:46:37] But that's that's what I carry in two to three people knew my but even then I always felt like I at least had to have a flip phone on me in case like.
[00:46:37 --> 00:46:43] What happens if you're out in the woods and break your leg or I don't know where like but they are now a part like this phones are a part of us.
[00:46:43 --> 00:46:45] We don't go anywhere without them.
[00:46:45 --> 00:46:46] We feel vulnerable.
[00:46:46 --> 00:46:47] We feel vulnerable without them.
[00:46:47 --> 00:46:51] So I know you really do like if you go for a quick walk with a phone.
[00:46:52 --> 00:47:01] So when the time comes when it's like will there if there even is a definitive time but it's like when we have to choose between integrating with AI and not most people are going to do it.
[00:47:01 --> 00:47:06] Yes people will this immediately submit and be a part of it and be maybe even excited to be a part of it.
[00:47:06 --> 00:47:09] It probably won't be a decision that you're allowed to make.
[00:47:09 --> 00:47:14] It's probably something that's going to be if you want to function in society you have to integrate.
[00:47:14 --> 00:47:19] Like we talked about in that text about how it feels like we're in an alternate dimension and it seems like there's these like things coming.
[00:47:19 --> 00:47:25] You know it's like it does it does it also it is just because things happen so fast and chaotic that we can't really keep up with anything.
[00:47:25 --> 00:47:34] One day the submarine collapses in the next day this other crazy thing happens and then you know I don't know it's just like it's so hard to keep up with what anything of what's really going on.
[00:47:34 --> 00:47:36] I think the problem is that we have to start.
[00:47:36 --> 00:47:48] Having people gather together again and hang out and not just make all of our hangouts digital because the systems like you said there's bots and algorithms and marketing approaches and psychology that's just deeply rooted.
[00:47:48 --> 00:48:05] It's just deeply rooted that goes into like just the way we fundamentally communicate now as societies and just globally like we all just talk on I mean got shot like I've used this example before somewhere talking but it's like I think about back when I was in high school like my high school girlfriend you know we would have some trivial argument about something.
[00:48:05 --> 00:48:14] There was no way that me and her were going to text and figure out how to fix that and now you know like and that was a high school relationship like there was over something stupid.
[00:48:14 --> 00:48:24] It's like real world problems you can't fix just texting and I don't think we can fix all this shit on X and Facebook and all that I think it's like it's I think people just have people are.
[00:48:24 --> 00:48:42] We're almost to the point now where we prefer socializing on the internet because it's almost like our minds have become more adapted to think that way but it's but it's we're in this digital world chasing and emulating all of the things that we're that are that we have this void from from not having in real life like.
[00:48:42 --> 00:48:59] I don't know it's it makes it very complicated to fix anything when we're the only way that we can we have this amazing intricate English language where all these words can mean all these different things and it's so easy to put everybody together in a digital space with AI and bots and manipulation and algorithms and big companies and.
[00:48:59 --> 00:49:05] How do you fix all that in that space it's just like it's you'll never it's like and how we're just in a house of mirrors you know.
[00:49:05 --> 00:49:16] You're you're just supposed to not engage that's what people need to stop doing but the problem is the consequences of the actions of the rest of the world do affect you if they're big.
[00:49:16 --> 00:49:25] And so you worry about the big ones so you pay attention so you got to pay attention to the bad news of eight billion people which is just unsustainable and.
[00:49:25 --> 00:49:32] It's also this ability to interact or not interact as you choose all throughout the day like you don't have to be invested in a conversation.
[00:49:32 --> 00:49:37] If you're not having a conversation and you ask me about something and I start to answer and I just wander off.
[00:49:37 --> 00:49:45] You're like how fucking rude but on the internet that's normal like so many posts something something to have a response an hour later and nobody cares it's like I guess he was busy.
[00:49:45 --> 00:50:00] You know it's normal because you're engaging and not engage it's very unhuman all of it is unhuman and it's all like constant even if you think you're immune to it there's this constant input of other people's thoughts into your own that makes you foggy.
[00:50:00 --> 00:50:03] It gives you, like, I was talking to Shogashon O'Malley about it once and he said,
[00:50:03 --> 00:50:07] I get a low level anxiety, just scrolling, I'm like, yeah, right?
[00:50:07 --> 00:50:08] Like, what is that?
[00:50:08 --> 00:50:13] I think it's on purpose, though, that's captive, that keeps you, it keeps you engaged, though.
[00:50:13 --> 00:50:15] Yeah, but I don't even know if it's on purpose.
[00:50:15 --> 00:50:20] I mean, I think it's just they figured it out along the way that people get engaged like that.
[00:50:20 --> 00:50:24] Like, that's why when you open up TikTok, it immediately starts playing any things.
[00:50:24 --> 00:50:26] Like, you're on the hook right away.
[00:50:26 --> 00:50:28] The Instagram, you got to choose.
[00:50:28 --> 00:50:32] Like, sometimes you make it a picture or someone's dog, oh, and then you scroll up and it's a music video.
[00:50:32 --> 00:50:37] And then you scroll up and it's a guy getting assassinated and you get to choose.
[00:50:37 --> 00:50:39] You know, with TikTok, they just start hammering you.
[00:50:39 --> 00:50:41] Even with Instagram, it seems very flashy.
[00:50:41 --> 00:50:45] Like, there's always stuff, you know, there's always sex always ends up somewhere in it.
[00:50:45 --> 00:50:47] Like, something gets popped up or whatever.
[00:50:47 --> 00:50:49] And you just, it's all for engagement.
[00:50:49 --> 00:50:53] That's your attention is what's worth so much money, which is so strange.
[00:50:53 --> 00:50:56] It's so strange, your data and your attention.
[00:50:56 --> 00:50:57] Nobody thought about the data part.
[00:50:57 --> 00:51:03] Boy, if we thought about the data part and they set up different regulations back in the 1990s
[00:51:03 --> 00:51:06] when AOL first burst onto the scene, if they realize like,
[00:51:06 --> 00:51:11] a data is going to be one of the most valuable things in tech companies that do nothing,
[00:51:11 --> 00:51:14] but offer you free email and a free search engine.
[00:51:14 --> 00:51:17] They're going to be the biggest fucking companies in the world.
[00:51:17 --> 00:51:19] And it's because of your data.
[00:51:19 --> 00:51:22] And they're going to be like, siphoning off your data without telling you about it.
[00:51:22 --> 00:51:23] They're going to be lying about it.
[00:51:23 --> 00:51:28] They're going to be running like little secret things with a snatching up your contact list
[00:51:28 --> 00:51:32] and snatching up your email and all your friends and trying to get them to buy shit.
[00:51:32 --> 00:51:33] It's like, wow.
[00:51:33 --> 00:51:37] Yeah, well, it looked, yeah, I mean, even just, that's what I mean,
[00:51:37 --> 00:51:38] even just a little bit of access.
[00:51:38 --> 00:51:43] I have to my fan base and like the reports that can be ran on like what they do
[00:51:43 --> 00:51:48] and what and who they are and like it's seeing it from that side.
[00:51:48 --> 00:51:52] It's just, it just really, it goes back to like I said,
[00:51:52 --> 00:51:56] just saying that I think we're right now in society.
[00:51:56 --> 00:52:00] Our job is to feed this machine.
[00:52:00 --> 00:52:04] And so, and it, no, like, it just knows entirely too much about all of us.
[00:52:04 --> 00:52:11] And that's very important in every aspect and whether it's in like comedy, music,
[00:52:11 --> 00:52:14] any kind of pop culture, like everything.
[00:52:14 --> 00:52:19] All of our reactions into behaviors to what is presented to us on these platforms.
[00:52:19 --> 00:52:25] Only makes it refined down even further and they're able to see like your lookalike audiences
[00:52:25 --> 00:52:29] and what they look at and where they shop and what they like and what their retention is
[00:52:29 --> 00:52:31] on certain videos that have this certain type of thing.
[00:52:31 --> 00:52:34] And it's like this hole just, it's just a lot of psychology that goes into it.
[00:52:34 --> 00:52:37] The people don't realize it's very easy to download the app and get on there and look.
[00:52:37 --> 00:52:40] And, but you don't have to pay attention to it.
[00:52:40 --> 00:52:41] You could just be yourself.
[00:52:41 --> 00:52:43] That's also possible.
[00:52:43 --> 00:52:47] That's, I just couldn't find a way to be on there and still,
[00:52:47 --> 00:52:50] the only time I'm ever on my profiles is if I'm with Draven or somebody,
[00:52:50 --> 00:52:54] and we're like looking through comments together and replying to stuff or doing things.
[00:52:54 --> 00:52:59] But I don't have any of, I haven't had anything logged in on any of my devices since last November.
[00:52:59 --> 00:53:01] Yeah, just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:53:01 --> 00:53:06] Like, that's, the thing that I was saying about what AI can't recreate in music.
[00:53:06 --> 00:53:11] Yeah, I'm sure there's AI songs and there was a great AI song by Drake that they made.
[00:53:11 --> 00:53:13] That they had to get removed, right?
[00:53:13 --> 00:53:15] Then they don't they remove those?
[00:53:15 --> 00:53:16] I think so.
[00:53:16 --> 00:53:19] But people still want to hear the real shit.
[00:53:19 --> 00:53:26] Like, the reason why your song became so popular was because you could really see it's just a guy with a guitar, like standing.
[00:53:26 --> 00:53:26] Yeah.
[00:53:26 --> 00:53:29] You know, grasp behind them and shit and a dog in the background.
[00:53:29 --> 00:53:34] There's a, there's a thousand more people that are way better than me that are in that same space.
[00:53:34 --> 00:53:39] And I think, I think my dream of this long term is to figure out how to like,
[00:53:39 --> 00:53:42] like, how do you get all those people into the limelight?
[00:53:42 --> 00:53:43] Like, yeah.
[00:53:43 --> 00:53:45] Like, what I've been working on since I guess, you know,
[00:53:45 --> 00:53:51] the one important thing to to drill home to people to as a follow-up since the last time we were here.
[00:53:51 --> 00:53:53] It goes back to that first conversation we had.
[00:53:53 --> 00:53:59] But, you know, your member, I was arguing that I really wanted to put all the money from Richmond into a nonprofit and not ever even touch it.
[00:53:59 --> 00:54:00] Because I was just, I didn't want all that.
[00:54:00 --> 00:54:02] I felt like it wasn't my money.
[00:54:02 --> 00:54:08] I felt like all those people went out of the way and supported me and like blew all these other huge songs off the chart.
[00:54:08 --> 00:54:10] And I just, I wanted it.
[00:54:10 --> 00:54:15] So, and then you said, well, no, don't do that because non-profits are sketchy and people are corrupt and like,
[00:54:15 --> 00:54:17] just keep the money yourself and then figure out how to do good with it.
[00:54:17 --> 00:54:21] And that was the biggest thing I walked away from that first conversation we had.
[00:54:21 --> 00:54:26] And so, you know, now it's like, that's the one thing I do want people to know too, though,
[00:54:26 --> 00:54:28] is like, that Richmond money and everything.
[00:54:28 --> 00:54:31] It's, it's went to good.
[00:54:31 --> 00:54:35] It's went to do a lot of, and what I think will be in the long run a lot of important things.
[00:54:35 --> 00:54:40] I've been buying, most of it's went towards buying land and stuff, but I've got this whole kind of crazy thing.
[00:54:40 --> 00:54:46] I'm, like, just a way for people to unscrew their minds to get reconnected in a nature.
[00:54:46 --> 00:54:48] And you're going to be a cult leader?
[00:54:48 --> 00:54:49] I was thinking about it.
[00:54:49 --> 00:54:50] Yeah.
[00:54:50 --> 00:54:51] Yeah.
[00:54:51 --> 00:54:54] Thinking about, I might, I might try to get with Verman Supreme.
[00:54:54 --> 00:54:57] He's got this cool idea about everybody having a free pony and stuff.
[00:54:57 --> 00:54:59] And I think that would work out.
[00:54:59 --> 00:55:01] You ever seen him, Verman?
[00:55:01 --> 00:55:02] No, who's that?
[00:55:02 --> 00:55:03] Verman Supreme.
[00:55:03 --> 00:55:04] Do you know who he is?
[00:55:05 --> 00:55:06] He runs for president.
[00:55:06 --> 00:55:08] I think he's from Connecticut.
[00:55:08 --> 00:55:10] Maybe he runs for president every time.
[00:55:10 --> 00:55:12] He wears a big boot on his head.
[00:55:12 --> 00:55:13] What?
[00:55:13 --> 00:55:14] Yeah.
[00:55:14 --> 00:55:15] I don't know this guy.
[00:55:15 --> 00:55:16] Yeah.
[00:55:16 --> 00:55:17] Yeah.
[00:55:17 --> 00:55:18] Yeah.
[00:55:18 --> 00:55:19] Yeah.
[00:55:19 --> 00:55:20] Yeah.
[00:55:20 --> 00:55:21] From that new hamster.
[00:55:21 --> 00:55:23] There's a video coming from that new hamster.
[00:55:23 --> 00:55:26] How do I not know about this guy?
[00:55:26 --> 00:55:28] He's a boot on his head.
[00:55:28 --> 00:55:29] Yeah.
[00:55:29 --> 00:55:33] He says he'll take, he's going to take everyone's guns away, but he'll give you ones that are better.
[00:55:33 --> 00:55:36] Says he runs on ginger vitis and zombie power.
[00:55:36 --> 00:55:41] He, uh, yeah, he has a mandatory toothbrushing policy and he'll say things like,
[00:55:41 --> 00:55:46] Well, no, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with the toothbrushing control camps and the
[00:55:46 --> 00:55:49] the dental hygiene authoritarian center.
[00:55:49 --> 00:55:50] I don't know.
[00:55:50 --> 00:55:52] He can't be some video of this cat.
[00:55:52 --> 00:55:53] Oh, my God.
[00:55:53 --> 00:55:54] I get it here.
[00:55:54 --> 00:55:58] The best one of him is from that new is from that Connecticut.
[00:55:58 --> 00:56:02] Um, that one like where he's wearing the yellow jacket, wherever that video is.
[00:56:02 --> 00:56:03] There you go.
[00:56:03 --> 00:56:08] Thank you.
[00:56:08 --> 00:56:15] Ginger vitis has been eroding the gum line of this great nation long enough and must be stopped
[00:56:15 --> 00:56:16] for too long.
[00:56:16 --> 00:56:18] This country has been suffering a great moral and oral decay.
[00:56:18 --> 00:56:19] It's going to be a duck.
[00:56:19 --> 00:56:26] A country's future depends on its ability to bite back.
[00:56:26 --> 00:56:30] We can no longer be a nation in indentured.
[00:56:30 --> 00:56:33] Our very salvation is at stake.
[00:56:33 --> 00:56:37] Together, we must brace ourselves.
[00:56:37 --> 00:56:44] As we cross over to the bridgework into the 23rd century, let us bite the bullet and together
[00:56:44 --> 00:56:51] make America a sea of shining smiles from sea to shiny sea.
[00:56:51 --> 00:56:55] Now friends, some people will tell you that this mandatory toothbrushing law is about the
[00:56:55 --> 00:56:57] secret dental police kicking down your door at 3 a.m.
[00:56:57 --> 00:56:58] Make sure you've brushed.
[00:56:58 --> 00:57:00] Friends, it is not.
[00:57:00 --> 00:57:06] Some will mention the dental reeducation centers or dental reeducation facilities.
[00:57:06 --> 00:57:08] It's about none of these things.
[00:57:08 --> 00:57:13] It's not about the government issue toothpaste containing an addictive yet harmless substance.
[00:57:13 --> 00:57:14] No friends.
[00:57:14 --> 00:57:22] It is not even about DNA gene splicing to create a race of winged monkeys to act as tooth fairies.
[00:57:22 --> 00:57:27] Friends, what this mandatory toothbrushing law is really about is strong teeth.
[00:57:27 --> 00:57:30] Talk America.
[00:57:30 --> 00:57:32] What does this get you for a living?
[00:57:32 --> 00:57:35] It looks like an open microphone you find at the comedy floor.
[00:57:35 --> 00:57:37] He looks like somebody that would be like a killed Tony.
[00:57:37 --> 00:57:42] He runs every time and he just tries to make it at the very end of this.
[00:57:42 --> 00:57:48] Whoever the guy is beside him running, he's like sprinkles dust all over him and says he's going to
[00:57:48 --> 00:57:49] make him gay.
[00:57:49 --> 00:57:53] He just makes, he's just in there making a mockery of it.
[00:57:53 --> 00:57:55] That's funny.
[00:57:55 --> 00:58:00] But yeah, that's who I have to team up with him for my call or whatever my toothbrushing call.
[00:58:00 --> 00:58:01] 100%.
[00:58:01 --> 00:58:02] You need him on board.
[00:58:02 --> 00:58:04] You need to be the toothbrush guy.
[00:58:04 --> 00:58:06] If you're going to have a call, you can't have stinky breath.
[00:58:06 --> 00:58:07] Yeah.
[00:58:07 --> 00:58:08] Got to keep it together.
[00:58:08 --> 00:58:11] But yeah, that's my, yeah, maybe it's like a cold or something.
[00:58:11 --> 00:58:17] But helping other musicians that they have talent, like giving them a vehicle, that's huge man.
[00:58:17 --> 00:58:22] There's a lot of people that just don't know how to get started.
[00:58:22 --> 00:58:29] And sometimes the thing that makes you a brilliant musician or even a brilliant comic makes you
[00:58:29 --> 00:58:32] bad at promoting because you're not thinking about yourself.
[00:58:32 --> 00:58:34] You're like really locked into the work.
[00:58:34 --> 00:58:36] You're really locked into your thing.
[00:58:36 --> 00:58:41] And it takes someone who's really thinking about themselves a lot and promoting them.
[00:58:41 --> 00:58:45] It's a totally different mindset to be like the social media guy.
[00:58:45 --> 00:58:52] Like to be like really into like social media videos and really into like promoting your gigs and really.
[00:58:52 --> 00:58:57] You know, so like a lot of guys fall by the wayside because they just never put their stuff out there.
[00:58:57 --> 00:59:00] Like there's some brilliant comics like, I don't want to make it special.
[00:59:00 --> 00:59:02] Like what you should put this out man.
[00:59:02 --> 00:59:03] This is great stuff.
[00:59:03 --> 00:59:05] But they're, they just want to kill.
[00:59:05 --> 00:59:06] They just want to go up.
[00:59:06 --> 00:59:10] Their, their thing every night is get on that stage and do the thing right.
[00:59:10 --> 00:59:11] And then rewrite it.
[00:59:11 --> 00:59:14] It's also the attention and stuff of it.
[00:59:14 --> 00:59:15] Uh-huh.
[00:59:15 --> 00:59:16] It's the, it's the not.
[00:59:16 --> 00:59:17] Yeah.
[00:59:17 --> 00:59:20] I mean, it's kind of what I, I kind of laugh when all this happening.
[00:59:20 --> 00:59:22] It was a scorn with the scornful song.
[00:59:22 --> 00:59:28] I was, I remember I called Draven like right after everything went up and everything was starting to move and I was like,
[00:59:28 --> 00:59:31] Oh, what if we done, you know, like, here we go.
[00:59:31 --> 00:59:34] Here comes the, the New York Post is going to come showing up again.
[00:59:34 --> 00:59:38] Am I, you know, my grandparents house next week again or whatever.
[00:59:38 --> 00:59:43] And this is like, but I think it's also just, yeah, people just maybe don't want the attention.
[00:59:43 --> 00:59:46] And there's a lot of really funny genuine people that do comedy.
[00:59:46 --> 00:59:50] But, and, and they can do, they can get up there and you have enough attention on to do the comedy.
[00:59:50 --> 00:59:52] But they don't want to be like, hey, look at me.
[00:59:52 --> 00:59:53] I mean, I fight that constantly.
[00:59:53 --> 00:59:56] Even like that little video where we were going in the playing yesterday.
[00:59:56 --> 00:59:59] And I said, playing by day, Joe Roganpot, you know, like,
[00:59:59 --> 01:00:04] I, you, you, you, you, you.
[01:00:00 --> 01:00:02] I don't even just make in little videos like that.
[01:00:02 --> 01:00:03] I feel way out of place.
[01:00:03 --> 01:00:07] Like, I don't want people to think like I'm saying,
[01:00:07 --> 01:00:08] hey, look at me, you know.
[01:00:08 --> 01:00:10] I mean, that's why I try to go through these periods
[01:00:10 --> 01:00:11] where I just don't post or I'm like,
[01:00:11 --> 01:00:13] I'm like, you were in a regular airport.
[01:00:13 --> 01:00:14] Yeah, the worst.
[01:00:14 --> 01:00:16] The worst is when people are doing those things
[01:00:16 --> 01:00:18] in front of a private jet, I'm like,
[01:00:18 --> 01:00:20] okay, we get it, you're rich.
[01:00:20 --> 01:00:22] You know, if people try to take photos of me in front of a jet,
[01:00:22 --> 01:00:26] I'm like, I'm not, I'm so not into this, I'm not.
[01:00:26 --> 01:00:28] I don't like the attention.
[01:00:28 --> 01:00:29] I don't want it.
[01:00:29 --> 01:00:30] I don't need it.
[01:00:30 --> 01:00:32] It's, which is weird, because I got a lot of it.
[01:00:32 --> 01:00:35] And I think it's probably why I don't want it.
[01:00:35 --> 01:00:36] Because I'm not looking for it.
[01:00:36 --> 01:00:37] Yeah, but you're also able to,
[01:00:37 --> 01:00:39] you're channeling it out through all these other.
[01:00:39 --> 01:00:40] I mean, think about all the things
[01:00:40 --> 01:00:43] that you've influenced and been a part of and done,
[01:00:43 --> 01:00:45] even just see this podcast and all the conversations
[01:00:45 --> 01:00:46] had in the information shared.
[01:00:46 --> 01:00:48] Like, it's not like you're just posted a bunch of pictures
[01:00:48 --> 01:00:50] with you shirt off, like, hey, look at me.
[01:00:50 --> 01:00:52] Like, you're using it.
[01:00:52 --> 01:00:53] I mean, I don't know.
[01:00:53 --> 01:00:55] I almost would say, I don't know that it's a coincidence
[01:00:55 --> 01:00:57] that you got put in this spot for a lot of reasons.
[01:00:57 --> 01:00:59] I mean, there's a lot, you probably don't even look
[01:00:59 --> 01:01:01] at it that way, but there's a lot of important things
[01:01:01 --> 01:01:02] that come out of this.
[01:01:02 --> 01:01:05] And all the other podcasts you've inspired that have done,
[01:01:05 --> 01:01:08] I mean, gosh, dude, there's no way to even calculate what you've,
[01:01:08 --> 01:01:10] if you'd never been born, there's no way to calculate
[01:01:10 --> 01:01:11] how many different things would be now.
[01:01:11 --> 01:01:14] Well, that's important to think about, though, you know,
[01:01:14 --> 01:01:17] like it's sort of, but from my perspective,
[01:01:17 --> 01:01:20] I was just one piece in this thing that happened.
[01:01:20 --> 01:01:21] Yeah.
[01:01:21 --> 01:01:24] And, you know, that's why I always have my friend Adam Curry on,
[01:01:24 --> 01:01:25] who's the original.
[01:01:25 --> 01:01:27] He's the pod father without him.
[01:01:27 --> 01:01:28] There would be none of this.
[01:01:28 --> 01:01:30] He figured out a way to do this.
[01:01:30 --> 01:01:33] And, you know, and then also Anthony Cumia,
[01:01:33 --> 01:01:35] from Opian Anthony and Tom Green.
[01:01:35 --> 01:01:38] Those are those are my number one influences.
[01:01:38 --> 01:01:41] And then Adam Corolla already had a podcast when I started.
[01:01:41 --> 01:01:45] I was like, oh, Adam went from radio to the internet.
[01:01:45 --> 01:01:46] Maybe I could do that.
[01:01:46 --> 01:01:47] I remember going to his place.
[01:01:47 --> 01:01:49] And, oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:01:49 --> 01:01:51] It's back when we were doing it on a little laptop.
[01:01:51 --> 01:01:53] I'm like, wow, Adam, I got a real studio.
[01:01:53 --> 01:01:55] It's got a poison chip.
[01:01:55 --> 01:01:57] And then, you know, we just kept doing it.
[01:01:57 --> 01:01:58] Just kept doing it.
[01:01:58 --> 01:02:00] You know, and then eventually it was webcams.
[01:02:00 --> 01:02:02] Okay, now it's not just the laptop camera.
[01:02:02 --> 01:02:04] It's actual webcams.
[01:02:04 --> 01:02:06] Okay. Now, maybe she had like real cameras.
[01:02:06 --> 01:02:07] Okay, let's get real cameras.
[01:02:07 --> 01:02:09] And then like, maybe she got a fucking studio.
[01:02:09 --> 01:02:11] So we tried it at the ice house for a little bit.
[01:02:11 --> 01:02:12] Like, maybe she got another place.
[01:02:12 --> 01:02:13] Then we got another place and I'm like,
[01:02:13 --> 01:02:15] I think I need a warehouse.
[01:02:15 --> 01:02:17] And then I'm like, I think I need armed security.
[01:02:17 --> 01:02:23] I think I need fucking special ops guys around me all the time.
[01:02:23 --> 01:02:25] And then it just kept going, man.
[01:02:25 --> 01:02:27] I remember the moment I've talked about this before,
[01:02:27 --> 01:02:29] but I didn't understand what was happening
[01:02:29 --> 01:02:32] until one day I was on stage in Chicago.
[01:02:32 --> 01:02:35] And I think this was 2012.
[01:02:35 --> 01:02:37] So I think I think it was around then.
[01:02:37 --> 01:02:40] So the podcast was only three years old.
[01:02:40 --> 01:02:42] And I didn't realize how many people watched it
[01:02:42 --> 01:02:43] or listened.
[01:02:43 --> 01:02:45] A lot of it was listening at the time.
[01:02:45 --> 01:02:49] Because I wasn't, I don't look at the numbers.
[01:02:49 --> 01:02:50] I just kind of key.
[01:02:50 --> 01:02:52] I feel like, well, that's bad for you.
[01:02:52 --> 01:02:53] You know, reading the comments, looking at the numbers.
[01:02:53 --> 01:02:55] I just like, do what you do.
[01:02:55 --> 01:02:56] That's why I do it exactly the same way.
[01:02:56 --> 01:02:59] I have a bunch of people on the no one has ever heard of.
[01:02:59 --> 01:03:01] And then a few bonos and stuff, you know,
[01:03:01 --> 01:03:03] every now and then I'll have Russell Crowe
[01:03:03 --> 01:03:05] on something crazy when we're all that crazy.
[01:03:05 --> 01:03:06] Dennis Quades here.
[01:03:06 --> 01:03:07] Yeah, you're Mel Gibson one.
[01:03:07 --> 01:03:08] Yeah.
[01:03:08 --> 01:03:09] He's the best.
[01:03:09 --> 01:03:12] But I was on stage in Chicago and I was telling the story
[01:03:12 --> 01:03:13] about the podcast.
[01:03:13 --> 01:03:15] I go, how many guys listen to the podcast?
[01:03:15 --> 01:03:19] Anyway, Chad was like 3,700 people in this place.
[01:03:19 --> 01:03:20] And they were all screaming.
[01:03:20 --> 01:03:24] And I went, whoa, yeah, that's when I realized.
[01:03:24 --> 01:03:27] Like at that moment, I was like, holy shit.
[01:03:27 --> 01:03:30] How big is this thing going to get?
[01:03:30 --> 01:03:31] And this is another funny thing.
[01:03:31 --> 01:03:32] When I went over the Spotify,
[01:03:32 --> 01:03:34] I was trying to get 10% less famous.
[01:03:34 --> 01:03:36] That was my goal.
[01:03:36 --> 01:03:39] My goal was to fade away.
[01:03:39 --> 01:03:40] My goal was like if someone has to pay me
[01:03:40 --> 01:03:42] and you have to go to this app to get it,
[01:03:42 --> 01:03:43] all the people that are getting at the other apps
[01:03:43 --> 01:03:44] are probably stop listening.
[01:03:44 --> 01:03:45] I think this would be great.
[01:03:45 --> 01:03:46] I'll get all the money.
[01:03:46 --> 01:03:48] And I'll just fucking drift into this place
[01:03:48 --> 01:03:50] where it's only like the hardcore fans
[01:03:50 --> 01:03:52] that make the track over to Spotify.
[01:03:52 --> 01:03:55] And then this fucking COVID thing happened.
[01:03:55 --> 01:03:56] Remember in the beginning of the podcast,
[01:03:56 --> 01:03:59] we lost 50% of our views and Jamie was on a hot panic.
[01:04:04 --> 01:04:05] Yeah, that's exactly what I meant earlier
[01:04:05 --> 01:04:07] about not putting a lot of songs out.
[01:04:07 --> 01:04:09] There's like a, there's some cool place
[01:04:09 --> 01:04:12] where you can be where you have your real fans
[01:04:12 --> 01:04:13] and you're having fun, but you're not
[01:04:13 --> 01:04:16] into all the sensationalism, all the crap, you know,
[01:04:16 --> 01:04:18] like, you can avoid all that.
[01:04:18 --> 01:04:19] You're a real guy.
[01:04:19 --> 01:04:19] You're a real dude.
[01:04:19 --> 01:04:22] I think one of the ways that the world has prepared you
[01:04:22 --> 01:04:27] for this is that you've lived a normal life for a long time.
[01:04:27 --> 01:04:30] You know, a normal life with no life performances,
[01:04:30 --> 01:04:32] no notoriety, no fame, no nothing.
[01:04:32 --> 01:04:36] You developed like when people wanna hear working man songs,
[01:04:36 --> 01:04:41] you fucking know Bruce Springsteen isn't a working man.
[01:04:41 --> 01:04:42] Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:04:42 --> 01:04:45] Like you probably was never really a working man.
[01:04:45 --> 01:04:46] He was never working on the docs.
[01:04:46 --> 01:04:47] You know what I mean?
[01:04:47 --> 01:04:50] He was never really a guy grinded it out.
[01:04:50 --> 01:04:53] He became famous pretty fucking young, you know?
[01:04:53 --> 01:04:56] They Bruce Springsteen in the East Street Band,
[01:04:56 --> 01:04:59] they got hot early, like they're great.
[01:04:59 --> 01:05:00] Don't get me wrong.
[01:05:00 --> 01:05:01] I mean, especially it's early,
[01:05:01 --> 01:05:03] it's not born to run fuck.
[01:05:03 --> 01:05:05] He's got some jams dude.
[01:05:05 --> 01:05:08] He's got some great songs, you know, brilliant disguise.
[01:05:08 --> 01:05:10] Oh, fucking love that song.
[01:05:10 --> 01:05:14] But you're a real working man.
[01:05:14 --> 01:05:17] Like you were a real working man
[01:05:17 --> 01:05:19] when you made rich men north of Richmond.
[01:05:19 --> 01:05:21] Like that is real.
[01:05:21 --> 01:05:22] And you can't fake that.
[01:05:22 --> 01:05:23] And people want that.
[01:05:23 --> 01:05:25] They want a fucking trucker hat.
[01:05:25 --> 01:05:26] They want ripped jeans.
[01:05:26 --> 01:05:29] They don't want like ripped jeans that are ripped from work.
[01:05:29 --> 01:05:29] You know what I mean?
[01:05:29 --> 01:05:32] They don't like real oil stains on your knees
[01:05:32 --> 01:05:34] because you're fixing your own car, you know?
[01:05:34 --> 01:05:37] Like that's what people want in this world.
[01:05:37 --> 01:05:39] They want authenticity.
[01:05:39 --> 01:05:41] And it's possible to maintain authenticity
[01:05:41 --> 01:05:42] regardless of how big you get.
[01:05:42 --> 01:05:43] It is possible.
[01:05:43 --> 01:05:44] And I think you can do it.
[01:05:44 --> 01:05:47] I think you can do it because you got here later in life.
[01:05:47 --> 01:05:50] You got here and lived a real life.
[01:05:50 --> 01:05:53] And then you made it into magical fantasy land
[01:05:53 --> 01:05:54] where we all live.
[01:05:54 --> 01:05:56] Yeah, well, the thing that I've gotten the most from you,
[01:05:56 --> 01:05:58] like I say, I don't look at my streaming numbers,
[01:05:58 --> 01:05:59] or anything, you know, that's what I mean.
[01:05:59 --> 01:06:02] Like when I finally did go back and look at Spotify,
[01:06:02 --> 01:06:05] like I after a year or a year and a half later
[01:06:05 --> 01:06:08] is just like, oh my god, like I'm still the thing, you know?
[01:06:08 --> 01:06:10] But some I agree with you there.
[01:06:10 --> 01:06:11] I don't look at the numbers.
[01:06:12 --> 01:06:14] I do catch myself reading a lot of the comments,
[01:06:14 --> 01:06:16] but only because a lot of them are important.
[01:06:16 --> 01:06:18] And I think some of the stories in them are important for me
[01:06:18 --> 01:06:21] to, I don't want to completely isolate myself from that.
[01:06:21 --> 01:06:24] And like I said, I also really like some of the negative ones, too.
[01:06:24 --> 01:06:26] I think negative ones are a lot less now than they used to be.
[01:06:26 --> 01:06:28] It was just really early on, people didn't understand
[01:06:28 --> 01:06:29] how everything happened.
[01:06:29 --> 01:06:31] And I really didn't understand it either.
[01:06:31 --> 01:06:32] That's why it's like whatever, you know?
[01:06:32 --> 01:06:37] But moving forward now, yeah, I've got a good, like core team of people.
[01:06:37 --> 01:06:39] I've got Draven from RadioWV.
[01:06:39 --> 01:06:41] I've got two or three people on staff.
[01:06:41 --> 01:06:44] I don't have a management company or a publicist, you know?
[01:06:44 --> 01:06:45] But that's the key.
[01:06:45 --> 01:06:48] I'm keeping it real low.
[01:06:48 --> 01:06:50] Well, I mean, it just amazed me when I came here for the first time
[01:06:50 --> 01:06:51] and saw the staff you have.
[01:06:51 --> 01:06:54] And then like, meet and lex, you know, lex does all of it.
[01:06:54 --> 01:06:55] He even turns his own cameras on.
[01:06:55 --> 01:06:57] And there's only lex in the whole place.
[01:06:57 --> 01:07:00] It's like, gosh, I don't need all these.
[01:07:00 --> 01:07:03] It's like a lot of those positions and jobs and services
[01:07:03 --> 01:07:06] that musicians use, I think they don't realize that they don't even need.
[01:07:06 --> 01:07:08] They just are like, oh, that's how it is in music.
[01:07:08 --> 01:07:09] That's what I want to check.
[01:07:09 --> 01:07:12] I want to, yeah, I don't know exactly.
[01:07:12 --> 01:07:14] It eliminates the executive influence.
[01:07:14 --> 01:07:16] It eliminates the corporate mindset.
[01:07:16 --> 01:07:18] It eliminates that because there's always going to be a person
[01:07:18 --> 01:07:21] that wants you to make a decision that's better for you financially.
[01:07:21 --> 01:07:25] Whereas like your instincts are guiding you towards the artistic decision.
[01:07:25 --> 01:07:26] Yeah.
[01:07:26 --> 01:07:29] And anytime those people get in the mix, they fuck everything up.
[01:07:29 --> 01:07:30] I'll give you a great example.
[01:07:30 --> 01:07:33] It's like the only, it's the only, like, call out on here that's negative.
[01:07:33 --> 01:07:39] That I'll say it all, is that just to show like how stuck in the mud,
[01:07:39 --> 01:07:43] the industry is and how much I think it's going to change in the near future
[01:07:43 --> 01:07:46] is leading up to the score and full release.
[01:07:46 --> 01:07:52] Me and Draven had went back and found about 30 or 40 people who just, without us even
[01:07:52 --> 01:07:54] knowing who they were, made the Richmond reaction videos.
[01:07:54 --> 01:07:59] And they were a big part of the push-up, especially long-term, you know, like,
[01:07:59 --> 01:08:01] people on TikTok and stuff that had made these videos.
[01:08:01 --> 01:08:07] And so I don't have, I own 100% of my publishing, you know, all the music's mind, thankfully.
[01:08:07 --> 01:08:11] I have my own label, technically, that collects the money, but you have to use a publishing
[01:08:11 --> 01:08:14] administration deal in order to collect money like overseas.
[01:08:14 --> 01:08:18] I don't know if you're familiar, if it's the same in comedy, but like, yeah, most any
[01:08:18 --> 01:08:21] musician, whether you're independent or you're with somebody, you have to have some kind
[01:08:21 --> 01:08:22] of pub admin.
[01:08:22 --> 01:08:26] And it's basically somebody that goes and helps you collect publishing money from
[01:08:26 --> 01:08:29] over, basically mostly from overseas is the way to understand, like all these obscure
[01:08:29 --> 01:08:32] places that money exists.
[01:08:32 --> 01:08:34] So Warner Chapel does it for me for 9%, right?
[01:08:34 --> 01:08:37] So they go collect all the stuff, they keep 9% of it.
[01:08:37 --> 01:08:41] They're the same to me as if I had a commercial landscape and company, manage in a property
[01:08:41 --> 01:08:42] for me.
[01:08:42 --> 01:08:47] So all I asked them to do was, hey, Warner Chapel, this six foot square of grass, where
[01:08:47 --> 01:08:51] all these reaction videos exist, just please whitelist these people, so they don't get
[01:08:51 --> 01:08:52] copyrighted.
[01:08:52 --> 01:08:55] I want them to actually make the money they make on the Scornful reaction videos, you
[01:08:55 --> 01:08:56] know?
[01:08:56 --> 01:08:59] Like, I don't, I don't feel right if they're going to go and make a Scornful Woman
[01:08:59 --> 01:09:04] reaction video or play drums over it or whatever, I don't want to take 50% of what,
[01:09:04 --> 01:09:07] you know what I mean, just don't copy, just whitelist them.
[01:09:07 --> 01:09:11] And it should have been, okay, great, good idea, you know?
[01:09:11 --> 01:09:15] And instead they just said, we can't do that, but it's for your protection.
[01:09:15 --> 01:09:21] So because they wanted the money, so they get a percentage and how do they, well, they
[01:09:21 --> 01:09:24] take 9% off of what I get.
[01:09:24 --> 01:09:29] But I tried to explain to them, we'll know, like, in the business sense, I even counter
[01:09:29 --> 01:09:30] argue to them.
[01:09:30 --> 01:09:32] And I was like, well, let's think about it in the business sense.
[01:09:32 --> 01:09:36] This little bit of money, right, that you're not going to collect off these reaction videos,
[01:09:36 --> 01:09:39] we'll generate, who knows how much traffic to the music, which is where the money
[01:09:39 --> 01:09:40] you really want.
[01:09:40 --> 01:09:43] And it shouldn't matter anyway, it's not there, it's not their shit to decide on
[01:09:43 --> 01:09:44] it's mine.
[01:09:44 --> 01:09:48] It's the same thing as if I hired a guy to cut the grass at my commercial property and
[01:09:48 --> 01:09:52] said, don't cut the six foot square and they're like, no, we're cutting all the grass.
[01:09:52 --> 01:09:57] And it's for your, so I had to get my attorney involved and spend like four grand and they
[01:09:57 --> 01:09:59] whitelist it them for 30 days.
[01:09:59 --> 01:10:00] And so I'm like, okay.
[01:10:00 --> 01:10:07] Okay, like that's why that's why all of you industry people are like so, you know, it's like that's why this is happening. That's why it's like
[01:10:08 --> 01:10:19] I don't know, just they don't care at all about the little guy or the people who are like doing all the work. They just I just picture all these like stinky library and type old people sitting around a table like
[01:10:20 --> 01:10:29] And you know, they can make all this money and make all these horrible decisions and poor all these millions of dollars in the songs they don't work and it doesn't matter because it's just like it it's not there they don't care they're getting their big salary
[01:10:30 --> 01:10:32] Yeah, so
[01:10:32 --> 01:10:37] So yeah, it's just even even in the even in the most menous school relationships. I've had a Nashville
[01:10:37 --> 01:10:43] I get resistance and push back and like it's on I don't know like why wouldn't they want me to whitelist those 30 people?
[01:10:43 --> 01:10:47] It's just a little stupid stuff like that that I've constantly dealt with so I've just decided now like I don't need
[01:10:47 --> 01:10:52] I just don't want to do anything in the music like I don't even need to be in the music business like in that sense, you know
[01:10:52 --> 01:10:56] I just I write my songs. I've recorded them. I got to do my shows and have fun
[01:10:56 --> 01:11:02] But I don't even need to follow any of the model of what of what like a traditional musician artist person would have done
[01:11:02 --> 01:11:11] You definitely don't need to do it that way. It's not necessary and you have the right mindset is that all those reaction videos
[01:11:11 --> 01:11:14] Just get more people to listen to your music. It's that's fast
[01:11:14 --> 01:11:21] But those are real those people were like real fans who went and did it not because they were trying to get traffic or money or whatever
[01:11:21 --> 01:11:28] They just like liked it and wanted to push it and so the least I can do is not take 50% of their stuff and like it just
[01:11:28 --> 01:11:33] But isn't that crazy that it's like there's nobody's ever done that I guess like before
[01:11:33 --> 01:11:40] They were just acting like that was just the craziest thing in the world. So I ended up releasing the scornful song through a company called sound on
[01:11:40 --> 01:11:47] Which is like the music distribution side of TikTok which seems like something I would never want to do
[01:11:47 --> 01:11:54] But they give me the flexibility to go and like and do all that they don't care because they're not music industry people
[01:11:54 --> 01:11:58] They're just social media people so I uploaded it through them basically
[01:11:58 --> 01:12:01] So I'm still I own all 100% of the rights. It's all my stuff
[01:12:01 --> 01:12:03] I don't have any deals or records or labels or anything
[01:12:03 --> 01:12:06] But they push it to the streaming services for me and they do all the stuff
[01:12:06 --> 01:12:10] So that way I'm not even having to use a music company to push my music
[01:12:10 --> 01:12:16] I can kind of just like not even be there at all. You know like not even being Nashville at all. That's the goal is just to get
[01:12:17 --> 01:12:21] And so now that I've got data from you know since Richmond basically and have
[01:12:22 --> 01:12:29] Learned a lot my goal long term is I want I'm in as always putting new music out and right stuff and you know
[01:12:29 --> 01:12:32] But it's gonna come in spurts and there'll be times where people won't see a lot of me
[01:12:32 --> 01:12:35] But I'm gonna be in the background with other people like I want to help
[01:12:35 --> 01:12:38] I want to find these people on TikTok that have like a hundred followers
[01:12:38 --> 01:12:42] But I know that they've got what it takes and get with like driving and some of these other people
[01:12:42 --> 01:12:46] I've met and like help them write some really good songs and record them and put them out and push them and just like
[01:12:46 --> 01:12:51] I would love to plant like 10 or 15 people in the music like give them everything I can give them to
[01:12:52 --> 01:12:59] To push them forward and make like that way it doesn't feel like I'm I'm the guy in the spotlight trying to like I feel like I'm just in a I feel like I'm like the most
[01:13:00 --> 01:13:06] I don't know these companies have got like all these employees and all this money and all this backing and it's literally like four or five of us taking them
[01:13:06 --> 01:13:14] I just I don't know to me I just think I I think there's strength in numbers if I could help more artists push forward and like help them break that
[01:13:14 --> 01:13:19] Cycle too that it would just some it would be like a multiple occasion factor on this whole thing. That's kind of what
[01:13:19 --> 01:13:26] That's gonna be kind of my next thing I get into is is helping produce music and doing festivals and like
[01:13:27 --> 01:13:34] Starting a label basically kind of sort of that's fucking awesome, but a non predatory one like even even when Draven put somebody on radio
[01:13:34 --> 01:13:36] WV if they get 30,000 views
[01:13:36 --> 01:13:40] There's already people trying to sign them like they just want control of every new thing that's
[01:13:41 --> 01:13:44] You know that's what they were trying to do to you right off the bat
[01:13:44 --> 01:13:47] I don't cut it is terrifying too to not do it just like I just
[01:13:48 --> 01:13:52] I felt like I was just everything it was everything in me felt wrong doing it, you know
[01:13:52 --> 01:13:56] But I just decided that I didn't care about it and that it I just you know
[01:13:56 --> 01:14:03] I remember being very adamant at the beginning that every decision moving forward was based off the fact that I wasn't scared to go back to my old job
[01:14:03 --> 01:14:09] If I had to because I'd rather go back to my old job and be me then go to Republic but just be Republic's little bitch
[01:14:09 --> 01:14:14] You know I have to do everything they want and say everything like and also seeing where all your profits go and
[01:14:15 --> 01:14:20] Realizing that you got hoodwinked into these deals because these deals when they give you a big chunk of money
[01:14:20 --> 01:14:24] You got to pay that money back. Yeah, that's all just an advance. Well if I had went with a label
[01:14:25 --> 01:14:30] I would have been a lot bigger though because they would have made me push 30 songs out of year and they would have put all this
[01:14:30 --> 01:14:36] Marketing money into and they would have kind of inflated me into this big fake like every other country superstar
[01:14:36 --> 01:14:41] And so it feels a lot better just kind of being a little little scaled back a little smaller
[01:14:41 --> 01:14:46] But yeah collecting 100% of my money and then also just knowing that I don't have a boss anymore other than
[01:14:46 --> 01:14:48] You know than the man upstairs like I don't
[01:14:49 --> 01:14:52] Gosh dude. I mean like I imagine how you know
[01:14:52 --> 01:14:57] I've heard stories from bands as stuff now that have told me that they've went and had to record music like under a label contract
[01:14:57 --> 01:15:02] And really didn't like the way the album turned out but still had to release it anyway like oh my gosh
[01:15:02 --> 01:15:06] That would just make me to have to put music out that I didn't think was good
[01:15:06 --> 01:15:12] They're gonna be loaded. I think I'm gonna just find it. Yeah, yeah, you don't want other people
[01:15:12 --> 01:15:15] Especially financial people ever be involved in your art
[01:15:16 --> 01:15:23] Ever even if they're good people like now we can we're gonna beneficial deal for both people. No, it's not gonna be beneficial for you
[01:15:23 --> 01:15:26] It's gonna influence you and it's gonna turn you in one way or another
[01:15:26 --> 01:15:30] It's not the way you would have originally gone on your own and the reason there's so much money in music is because
[01:15:30 --> 01:15:35] Music such a big part of us as human beings and it's like it's so funny the first thing they do when they
[01:15:36 --> 01:15:40] Sign somebody is like trying to rip their identity away and it's like you they it's like the labels don't understand
[01:15:40 --> 01:15:44] That it's the identity of the person that put him in the position. They're in in the first place
[01:15:44 --> 01:15:46] It's like you said there were a laid ability of it, you know
[01:15:47 --> 01:15:50] Well, there's also people have this instinct to try to influence people
[01:15:50 --> 01:15:55] So there's one of the things that executives do in the beginning when someone's just starting they like you know what you should do
[01:15:55 --> 01:16:00] You should get a crew cut. I think you'd look great with a crew cut and then like the crew cut was my idea
[01:16:00 --> 01:16:03] Yeah, you know something about Oliver's crew cut everybody loves that crew cut. Yeah
[01:16:03 --> 01:16:07] It's just like he doesn't give a fuck about his hair. That was my idea. Yeah, you know
[01:16:07 --> 01:16:11] There's a little of that because like people are easily influenced because like in the beginning
[01:16:11 --> 01:16:16] You're not sure like I can't even believe what got signed like I'm not gonna be a star these people all here for me
[01:16:16 --> 01:16:18] You know and they'll fucking
[01:16:18 --> 01:16:20] Get in there. That's happened to me. I mean I brought
[01:16:21 --> 01:16:27] Around February or so I hired this management company that stayed they were my management company for three weeks
[01:16:27 --> 01:16:29] So that kind of tells you how well things worked
[01:16:29 --> 01:16:35] But he was super nice like loved everything I was doing and then as soon as I got as soon as I started with him
[01:16:35 --> 01:16:37] He was telling other people that I know like yeah
[01:16:37 --> 01:16:42] We got to figure out how to make him cool and he needs to put like 40 or 50 songs out this year
[01:16:42 --> 01:16:44] And they were wanting me to make the social media posts like
[01:16:44 --> 01:16:50] Complimenting Beyonce's country album because he thought it was gonna get me in a position like it's exactly what you're saying
[01:16:50 --> 01:16:56] It's just like and I just told him I was like dude. I if I wanted to just be if I just wanted to be somebody's little like
[01:16:57 --> 01:17:00] Somebody's little puppet. There's a lot I would have taken a lot more money for it like you know
[01:17:00 --> 01:17:03] I'm independent so I don't have to do that. It's like
[01:17:04 --> 01:17:08] But that's like and it's like the thing is is I don't need to be cool
[01:17:08 --> 01:17:11] It's okay that I'm kind of lame and I just but I'm just me and you know it is what it is
[01:17:11 --> 01:17:14] It's like I don't have to I don't have to try to get on the internet and pretend to be cool
[01:17:14 --> 01:17:21] There's a cool man. Stop this. You're cool. You're not lame. You're not lame at all. What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:17:21 --> 01:17:25] You're a cool guy. You make great music and you're thanks fun hang out with how you how you lame
[01:17:26 --> 01:17:30] Because you're normal guess what everybody's normal. It's a ruse Beyonce's normal too
[01:17:30 --> 01:17:33] She takes horrible shit. I'm sure we all do we all do
[01:17:34 --> 01:17:38] It's there's humans human beings man. This illusion of celebrity
[01:17:39 --> 01:17:43] It's complete total nonsense. Dude. That's the best thing. Yeah, everybody takes horrible shit
[01:17:44 --> 01:17:51] You want to bring gummy I was hoping you had some of the Alex Jones ones. Well, he's just an on it once the new
[01:17:51 --> 01:17:56] They're Alphabre and gummies. We just got him how is Alex doing he's the use great wash a lot of weight
[01:17:56 --> 01:18:00] I saw he's getting like yeah, yeah, he's ready for the next one John Johnson's training
[01:18:00 --> 01:18:04] I really yeah, he gets up every morning. He works out for fucking hours. He's lost
[01:18:04 --> 01:18:09] I think he's lost 70 pounds at this point. He looks fantastic man. Yeah
[01:18:09 --> 01:18:14] He looks fantastic. He looks like he's 20 years younger people think this is we're a footic as you know
[01:18:14 --> 01:18:16] His whole business is conspiracy theorists
[01:18:16 --> 01:18:21] conspiracy that Alex has been replaced. Yeah. Yeah listen folks. That's real Alex
[01:18:21 --> 01:18:26] I've watched every step of the way in my friend train some so I can tell you for a fact
[01:18:26 --> 01:18:31] That is the real Alex Jones quit drinking quit fucking around quitting bad food
[01:18:31 --> 01:18:36] He's eating healthy food now. He works out every day. It's like no-o's epic no bullshit no shortcuts
[01:18:37 --> 01:18:44] He did it the right way. He looks great. Yeah, yeah, he's he's definitely he's definitely one of my bucket list people with me
[01:18:44 --> 01:18:50] I can do she to Alex. Yeah, we can make that happen for sure 100%. It'd be just not about that. Just be holy
[01:18:50 --> 01:18:54] That's done. Done. Done. Nice. Yeah. We'll look that up
[01:18:55 --> 01:19:00] Be prepared that'd be interesting conversation. Yeah, cuz off air. He's just like he's on air
[01:19:00 --> 01:19:02] He's a he's a that's Alex Jones. He's ready to go
[01:19:02 --> 01:19:05] Yeah, Billy and fucking what Bill Gates doing right now
[01:19:07 --> 01:19:11] How does he get in the way with that? Well, but thanks do it to pay off all the mass media
[01:19:11 --> 01:19:14] If you see there's a $350 million donation that he gave it all
[01:19:14 --> 01:19:21] Media companies like what 350 is that real? Then Jamie will look it up like whole leaf. Yeah, no, he's he's right a lot of the time
[01:19:21 --> 01:19:23] He's right most of the time except that one big one
[01:19:23 --> 01:19:24] But other than yeah
[01:19:24 --> 01:19:28] But he's gonna get that with like they say like the kids say you get that with those big jobs, you know
[01:19:28 --> 01:19:37] What also I think happens and this is I think this is 100% real is that there are a bunch of fake stories that get propagated to people
[01:19:37 --> 01:19:43] That are really invested in conspiracy theories hoping that those people promote those fake conspiracy theories and then get out
[01:19:43 --> 01:19:52] As being wrong, yeah, you know, I think you can get caught up in that and then I also think if you're real quick to not check
[01:19:52 --> 01:19:55] And I'm guilty of that all the time to see if something's legit
[01:19:55 --> 01:19:59] You know, that's one of the vital roles of Jamie plays like Jay like
[01:20:00 --> 01:20:00] Maybe that's not real.
[01:20:00 --> 01:20:03] Like what, why are you fucking this up, Jamie?
[01:20:03 --> 01:20:04] Like we want it to be a real, right?
[01:20:04 --> 01:20:06] You want a nice juicy conspiracy to be real.
[01:20:08 --> 01:20:11] And then also, at the time of the Sandy Hook stop,
[01:20:11 --> 01:20:13] he was drinking like a lot.
[01:20:13 --> 01:20:16] And I think he was genuinely overwhelmed
[01:20:16 --> 01:20:18] by all the real stuff that he was finding.
[01:20:18 --> 01:20:21] You know, when he's getting into the Iraq war
[01:20:21 --> 01:20:22] and all these different things,
[01:20:22 --> 01:20:24] it's like he was just overwhelmed man.
[01:20:24 --> 01:20:27] I think he had a psychotic break, you know,
[01:20:27 --> 01:20:29] and he'll be the first to say that too.
[01:20:30 --> 01:20:32] It's like when you're your whole business
[01:20:32 --> 01:20:35] is uncovering insane conspiracies.
[01:20:35 --> 01:20:38] If everybody thinks you're out of your fucking mind,
[01:20:38 --> 01:20:39] and then 20 years later,
[01:20:39 --> 01:20:44] they're like, holy, shitty was right about every step of the way.
[01:20:44 --> 01:20:47] He was telling me about central bank digital currency,
[01:20:47 --> 01:20:49] connected to a social credit score system
[01:20:49 --> 01:20:51] that it's game over, because they'll lock you in
[01:20:51 --> 01:20:52] just like they've done with China.
[01:20:52 --> 01:20:56] And he was like, seeing this like a decade plus ago.
[01:20:56 --> 01:20:57] I was like, what?
[01:20:57 --> 01:21:01] Yeah, it's great, like the guy before him that I think,
[01:21:01 --> 01:21:03] I think the two of them actually didn't get along,
[01:21:03 --> 01:21:06] but I always, if I ever do meet Alex,
[01:21:06 --> 01:21:07] I was gonna ask him out that is Bill Cooper,
[01:21:07 --> 01:21:09] but he was a guy who kind of came before Alex,
[01:21:09 --> 01:21:10] that's something.
[01:21:10 --> 01:21:12] He'd be holding a pair of horses, right?
[01:21:12 --> 01:21:12] Yeah.
[01:21:12 --> 01:21:14] But yeah, even back then, it just,
[01:21:14 --> 01:21:17] most of it seemed like total madness back then.
[01:21:17 --> 01:21:20] And now it's like, but it's just sort of like,
[01:21:20 --> 01:21:21] I laugh about when I was a kid,
[01:21:21 --> 01:21:23] everyone thought that Michael Jackson was the big,
[01:21:23 --> 01:21:26] like sexually perverted guy, and who knows with Mike,
[01:21:26 --> 01:21:29] but now I look at Michael as like this,
[01:21:29 --> 01:21:31] just kid that was put in this terrible position
[01:21:31 --> 01:21:33] from a child up, and now all these other musicians
[01:21:33 --> 01:21:35] that you wouldn't even think are the sex predators are.
[01:21:35 --> 01:21:37] It's just kind of like, we just don't really know
[01:21:37 --> 01:21:39] much of anything anyway, but yeah, like with that.
[01:21:39 --> 01:21:41] With the Michael Jackson thing too,
[01:21:41 --> 01:21:43] his doctor said that he was chemically castrated
[01:21:43 --> 01:21:47] when he was young, to maintain his voice.
[01:21:47 --> 01:21:51] And I believe him, because that totally makes sense.
[01:21:51 --> 01:21:55] You look at his frame, his really thin frame,
[01:21:55 --> 01:21:58] where it doesn't really get as any testosterone.
[01:21:58 --> 01:22:01] Look at all his brothers, his brothers are like thick,
[01:22:01 --> 01:22:02] like manly.
[01:22:02 --> 01:22:04] What does chemically castrated mean exactly?
[01:22:04 --> 01:22:06] Well, do I even want to say something?
[01:22:06 --> 01:22:07] It's hormone blockers.
[01:22:07 --> 01:22:10] That's exactly what they're doing to trans kids now.
[01:22:10 --> 01:22:10] Yeah.
[01:22:10 --> 01:22:11] It's the same thing.
[01:22:11 --> 01:22:13] And that's why Michael Jackson had that voice.
[01:22:13 --> 01:22:17] It's very similar to a castraught as voice.
[01:22:17 --> 01:22:19] Do you know what a castraught it was?
[01:22:19 --> 01:22:22] So these kids in opera were faster.
[01:22:22 --> 01:22:23] Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:23 --> 01:22:26] And there's only one available recording, I think.
[01:22:26 --> 01:22:28] It's just like one guy, right?
[01:22:28 --> 01:22:29] Have you ever heard it?
[01:22:29 --> 01:22:31] A long time ago, yeah, I'd like to hear it.
[01:22:31 --> 01:22:33] Let's listen to some of it,
[01:22:33 --> 01:22:34] because it's fucking creepy.
[01:22:34 --> 01:22:37] I've just heard stories about like about that being the thing
[01:22:37 --> 01:22:39] that we can get to a voice children,
[01:22:39 --> 01:22:41] so that they never had testosterone,
[01:22:41 --> 01:22:44] so that their body never really developed.
[01:22:44 --> 01:22:49] And then they would have them maintain that young voice,
[01:22:49 --> 01:22:51] that high pitch that's only possible.
[01:22:51 --> 01:22:54] If you don't develop, the deepness that comes with,
[01:22:54 --> 01:22:58] that's why when trans men, when women start taking testosterone,
[01:22:58 --> 01:23:01] their voice starts getting deeper, things start getting weird,
[01:23:01 --> 01:23:04] and they start getting very dwayne Johnson.
[01:23:04 --> 01:23:05] You know, it's like that's testosterone.
[01:23:05 --> 01:23:09] That's what it has on your voice.
[01:23:09 --> 01:23:12] And these poor fox,
[01:23:14 --> 01:23:16] Alessandro Mareski.
[01:23:17 --> 01:23:20] I don't want to go.
[01:23:20 --> 01:23:21] Don't make fun of them.
[01:23:21 --> 01:23:23] It's a beautiful woman.
[01:23:27 --> 01:23:31] This is a grown man, right?
[01:23:31 --> 01:23:33] He has to grow man.
[01:23:42 --> 01:23:43] Is this a grown man?
[01:23:43 --> 01:23:45] Yes, he has to grow man.
[01:23:45 --> 01:23:57] That would be like sampled in the next Kanye song or something like that.
[01:23:57 --> 01:23:59] Yeah, we can leave it there.
[01:23:59 --> 01:24:01] We don't have to play anymore, but it's so haunting.
[01:24:01 --> 01:24:02] It's so haunting.
[01:24:02 --> 01:24:07] First of all, what fucking psycho figured out that if you cut off little boys balls,
[01:24:07 --> 01:24:09] you could make them sing like that forever?
[01:24:09 --> 01:24:12] Like what fucking psycho was the first person to do that?
[01:24:12 --> 01:24:13] Yeah.
[01:24:13 --> 01:24:14] Cause these are little kids they're doing it to it.
[01:24:15 --> 01:24:19] Like six year olds was this in the church was this like a church thing or I do not know.
[01:24:19 --> 01:24:20] It was an opera thing.
[01:24:20 --> 01:24:21] But I know opera thing.
[01:24:21 --> 01:24:27] Castrating men, you know, Unix was a common thing when people were working in the
[01:24:27 --> 01:24:30] the homes of Royals, they'd castrate them.
[01:24:30 --> 01:24:34] There's one of the most horrific stories was Nero.
[01:24:34 --> 01:24:42] Nero beat his wife to death and then took a slave boy who looked like his wife and castrated
[01:24:42 --> 01:24:47] him and changed his name to his wife and presented him as his wife.
[01:24:47 --> 01:24:48] Yeah.
[01:24:48 --> 01:24:52] People in power have always been horrible.
[01:24:52 --> 01:24:53] Yeah.
[01:24:53 --> 01:24:56] People when they get unchecked power have always been horrible.
[01:24:56 --> 01:25:01] That's why directionally like this whole no kings protest that's supposed to go down
[01:25:01 --> 01:25:05] on Saturday, directionally it's correct, but you don't want kings, you don't want all
[01:25:05 --> 01:25:08] gars, but who's funding it?
[01:25:08 --> 01:25:10] Which turns out it's funded by an all-guard.
[01:25:10 --> 01:25:16] It's their funded by a lady worth $20 billion, who is the ares to Walmart, who Walmart
[01:25:16 --> 01:25:19] a company that employs cheap labor and sells a lot of stuff from China that would be
[01:25:19 --> 01:25:21] affected by tariffs.
[01:25:21 --> 01:25:25] You know, it's like that with all of them though, it's like it's like that with everything
[01:25:25 --> 01:25:26] man.
[01:25:26 --> 01:25:31] Everything is like it presents as being this moral situation, like you're really looking
[01:25:31 --> 01:25:37] out for you, really looking out for people, they're never really looking out for people.
[01:25:37 --> 01:25:43] There's always some primary profit motive that's causing any organized thing, all
[01:25:43 --> 01:25:48] doesn't, it's never for the human race, it's not unless the people are all on mushrooms.
[01:25:48 --> 01:25:52] It's never for the human race and until mushrooms get legalized, it's probably never
[01:25:52 --> 01:25:55] going to happen and that's the real battle.
[01:25:55 --> 01:25:59] The real battle is what gets legal first, AI or mushrooms.
[01:25:59 --> 01:26:00] You know?
[01:26:00 --> 01:26:01] Yeah.
[01:26:01 --> 01:26:05] Both of us will lead towards God, both of them will lead towards God, but one with a completely
[01:26:05 --> 01:26:06] different outcome.
[01:26:06 --> 01:26:10] It's going to take me like four or five times listening to it to be able to talk about it,
[01:26:10 --> 01:26:15] but I've went back and listened to the maps of meaning on audible and it's wanted
[01:26:15 --> 01:26:19] Jordan's earlier works, you know, when he's talking about society and how it's structured
[01:26:19 --> 01:26:24] and basically talks about like the motivations and the origins of why people always resort
[01:26:24 --> 01:26:25] to evil.
[01:26:25 --> 01:26:29] You know, I mean, we talk so much about the Holocaust, but not at all about all the other
[01:26:29 --> 01:26:30] horrible tragedies.
[01:26:30 --> 01:26:32] They happen there at the same time, but even like talking about with Russia, like just
[01:26:32 --> 01:26:36] think about the Soviet Union and what happened there and how easily people were turned
[01:26:36 --> 01:26:37] again.
[01:26:37 --> 01:26:42] It's just we at this little moment in time or in it's just so we should just be so thankful
[01:26:42 --> 01:26:43] for it.
[01:26:43 --> 01:26:46] Even though it is mass chaos right now, like the fact that we can the fact that people
[01:26:46 --> 01:26:50] are allowed to speak freely and do things and have had the influence and power they do,
[01:26:50 --> 01:26:54] it's just nuts when you think about you're right, I mean, it's the same crazy people
[01:26:54 --> 01:26:58] that we're arguing about today have always existed in different forms and with different
[01:26:58 --> 01:26:59] names and faces.
[01:26:59 --> 01:27:04] But we are better off today than anybody else in human history and this is a struggle
[01:27:04 --> 01:27:08] and it is a battle, but I think we can come out of this on the other side.
[01:27:08 --> 01:27:12] We all realize that we would be in play against each other and that's where it's important.
[01:27:12 --> 01:27:16] You know, when you're paying people to protest, you're leaving pallets of bricks around
[01:27:16 --> 01:27:20] and you're organizing the whole thing and you're shipping people in on buses and you're
[01:27:20 --> 01:27:23] making sure that all the people show up at a certain amount of time and they're all compensated
[01:27:23 --> 01:27:28] and you give them water and snacks like we got to realize what's going on here.
[01:27:28 --> 01:27:29] This is not for you.
[01:27:29 --> 01:27:32] When you light your city on fire and you burn cop cars, it's never good, it's not good
[01:27:32 --> 01:27:35] for you, it's not good for the cause, it's not going to change the laws.
[01:27:35 --> 01:27:41] One thing that I heard from Trump today that I thought was very promising is that he wants
[01:27:41 --> 01:27:46] to make an executive order where people that are here for a long time that have been
[01:27:46 --> 01:27:51] like working on farms that are undocumented, that they won't be targeted and that they'll
[01:27:51 --> 01:27:53] be exempt from all this stuff.
[01:27:53 --> 01:27:59] This is my feeling, like if you got here and you've integrated into our society,
[01:27:59 --> 01:28:02] yeah, maybe you shouldn't have snuck in, but you did it and you're not breaking any laws,
[01:28:02 --> 01:28:06] you're a hardworking person, those people need a path to citizenship, man.
[01:28:06 --> 01:28:11] Because if you don't, then they're just pred upon by people that will take advantage
[01:28:11 --> 01:28:14] of the fact that they're undocumented and not paying what they're legally supposed to
[01:28:14 --> 01:28:18] pay them and not giving benefits if they're legally supposed to have benefits and they
[01:28:18 --> 01:28:21] can't say anything because they're worried that immigration's going to get called on
[01:28:21 --> 01:28:25] so that these people are in this constant state of anxiety and then they hear about
[01:28:25 --> 01:28:28] the ice rates, like at home deep-o, like what the fuck?
[01:28:28 --> 01:28:34] Yeah, there was a big ice rate at the Facebook data center job, not far from my place
[01:28:34 --> 01:28:36] where I used that to go, was it?
[01:28:36 --> 01:28:38] Facebook data center, ice rate?
[01:28:38 --> 01:28:43] Yeah, the Facebook project, it's not far from me in Virginia, I think it's technically
[01:28:43 --> 01:28:47] would be in South Boston, I think it's technically in South Boston.
[01:28:47 --> 01:28:50] Ice date is, Facebook didn't bribe ice.
[01:28:50 --> 01:28:58] There's a big job that I used to have to go on some that's in the southern part of Virginia,
[01:28:58 --> 01:29:02] like not far from North Carolina and somebody was sending me pictures there from the other day,
[01:29:02 --> 01:29:07] but they had a big ice rate and there was dudes running through the, like, people were just
[01:29:07 --> 01:29:10] escaping the job, like running away from the job and stuff, isn't it?
[01:29:10 --> 01:29:11] Why?
[01:29:11 --> 01:29:12] Why?
[01:29:12 --> 01:29:15] Like gang members, yes, criminals, yes, this why?
[01:29:15 --> 01:29:16] Why?
[01:29:16 --> 01:29:23] Like, I think as crazy as it sounds, the only way to do this and look like you have a heart
[01:29:23 --> 01:29:29] is evaluate people on a case-by-case basis, like this is good people, it's good people.
[01:29:29 --> 01:29:33] It's also so complicated because it goes back for so long and the idea, the thing now
[01:29:33 --> 01:29:36] is that there's two very polarizing opinions of what America even is, a represents her
[01:29:36 --> 01:29:41] what job it's supposed to serve to the world, so like, you know, in some, yeah, sure,
[01:29:41 --> 01:29:45] like, for any country to exist, it has to have, there has to be something there that
[01:29:45 --> 01:29:49] identifies what it is as a country and you have, and like, there's like, yeah, like it just seems
[01:29:49 --> 01:29:54] like without citizenship or without some definitive thing, if who's a citizen or not, it's like,
[01:29:54 --> 01:29:59] then it's not even a country, it's like, and most every country has some, like, the idea of their,
[01:30:00 --> 01:30:03] no immigration laws for a country means that it's no longer a country, but I also think it's
[01:30:03 --> 01:30:11] like, the opposite side of that, too, is like America has always, in theory even though it's
[01:30:11 --> 01:30:16] always been ran by these, there's always been these corrupt people involved in it. In theory,
[01:30:16 --> 01:30:20] you know, America was started as sort of this thing that was like, that can maybe be like,
[01:30:22 --> 01:30:28] like a sanctuary that like, that doesn't allow the, doesn't allow monarchies and dictators
[01:30:28 --> 01:30:34] and horrible things, you know, like, as bad as America, maybe has been in certain cases like
[01:30:34 --> 01:30:40] the fact that when Japan laws, they didn't just go and take it over and call it another part of
[01:30:40 --> 01:30:45] America, like they went and tried to rebuild, like, in theory, America's supposed to be this
[01:30:45 --> 01:30:50] vein that exists of, you know, it's, it's, it's originate, it's origination is from people who
[01:30:50 --> 01:30:54] wanted to get away from monarchies and dictators and, of course, like, it's so easy to pick on the
[01:30:54 --> 01:30:58] founding fathers and all their faults and the crazy things they did, but it was centuries ago,
[01:30:58 --> 01:31:02] in a different culture and they probably were all maniacs. He'd have to be a maniac to,
[01:31:02 --> 01:31:07] to go up against the world's biggest empire and take it on, you know, like, musk it with a
[01:31:07 --> 01:31:12] fucking, yeah, like, you'd have to be crazy and, of course, they had personality flaws, but they
[01:31:12 --> 01:31:16] were, the reality is is that, here's the thing that sucks is like, and it goes both ways,
[01:31:16 --> 01:31:20] there's a lot of things about people on the left that people on the right don't realize
[01:31:20 --> 01:31:24] that they haven't come and it's the same way with this, like, I, it breaks my heart when people
[01:31:24 --> 01:31:28] just totally trash the founding fathers, not because they were these morally, they took
[01:31:28 --> 01:31:32] horrendous shits too, I'm sure, probably not as bad as Beyonce, but pretty close. And, you know,
[01:31:32 --> 01:31:36] the fact, like, of course they were bad people, they were all bad, we're humans, we're flawed,
[01:31:36 --> 01:31:40] inherently, even the best of us, even the ones who act like, we're the best and the most,
[01:31:40 --> 01:31:43] like, we're all screwed up, we all have our problems and our faults and stuff, but the fact
[01:31:43 --> 01:31:48] that they were willing to, like, go somewhere to another land with all these, with all this crazy
[01:31:48 --> 01:31:53] stuff and then take on the, you know, the world's biggest empire at that time, just so they could
[01:31:53 --> 01:31:57] be able to do what they, you know, religious freedom, it's like, they didn't want really just
[01:31:57 --> 01:32:01] freedom because they were not even necessarily because they wanted to go to church. I always thought
[01:32:01 --> 01:32:05] it was like, it's so weird that they, they were fighting for religion, but it wasn't that they were
[01:32:05 --> 01:32:09] fighting for religion, they were fighting for the mandate of religion for the, they were, they were
[01:32:09 --> 01:32:14] tired of the church and like, I know it's not considered the church anymore, but there is still
[01:32:14 --> 01:32:19] a church that dominates us and tries to control us now and that now, unfortunately now the church
[01:32:19 --> 01:32:24] is just sort of this weird thing, but it's the, it's a zebra mentality, you know, among politicians,
[01:32:24 --> 01:32:28] it's like it goes back to that, I think it's Jordan Peterson that talks about the zebras and how
[01:32:28 --> 01:32:31] they'll do a study on zebras and they'll, it's in the maps of meaning book, I believe, and they'll
[01:32:31 --> 01:32:37] mark one red to study it and then the predators take that zebra down because the zebra is stripes,
[01:32:37 --> 01:32:41] aren't camouflage to their surroundings, they're camouflage to each other so they're not easily
[01:32:41 --> 01:32:45] identifyable. And so four, five lions can't take one zebra down if they all look the same.
[01:32:45 --> 01:32:49] And in politics, I believe that's what's happened, especially on the left, you know,
[01:32:50 --> 01:32:55] I had people in Nashville quit working with me because I, I talked about this when I was at the
[01:32:55 --> 01:33:02] rhyming, but we had this, this, this, this dancing, this chick that plays the fiddle and she does
[01:33:02 --> 01:33:06] like flat dancing and stuff named Hilary Klug, who lives in Nashville and we had her come to the
[01:33:06 --> 01:33:11] rhyming to do this show with us and it was on a last minute thing and I'm about to introduce her
[01:33:11 --> 01:33:16] and I tell the crowd, I'm like, hey, you know, I said, I got Hilary about to come out and I was like,
[01:33:16 --> 01:33:21] but it's not, don't worry, it's not that Hilary and just made it all tough. Just made a joke about it.
[01:33:21 --> 01:33:25] Well, I just, somebody said something in the crowd that was, and I don't know, I just interact,
[01:33:25 --> 01:33:28] and I just say what comes among, I don't care, you know, I don't worry about all that stuff
[01:33:28 --> 01:33:32] and what people might think, I just try to say what I feel. But I was like, you know, isn't
[01:33:32 --> 01:33:36] it crazy that somebody like Hilary who not that long ago, I can remember vividly and as a
[01:33:36 --> 01:33:41] child or an teenage years, like being completely against the idea of even having two people of the
[01:33:41 --> 01:33:48] same gender be married. Like she was as against gay marriage is like any, any person on the far
[01:33:48 --> 01:33:52] right is now, you know, and that was, that was, that was in my childhood early, and I said, and now
[01:33:52 --> 01:33:56] the fact that now that it's okay for kids to become transgender and go through like what Michael did,
[01:33:57 --> 01:34:01] that's to me is just it just shows that it's all theatrics and that none of those people really
[01:34:01 --> 01:34:06] have any real like opinions about any of the stuff. It's all about what will sell, you know, like
[01:34:06 --> 01:34:12] did you say this at the rhyme? I said this at the rhyme and so I had my, I had my management company
[01:34:12 --> 01:34:15] that I was using and then dropped me and a bunch of other people without even telling me they
[01:34:15 --> 01:34:19] just emailed my attorney and said they couldn't work with me anymore. They were that mad about that,
[01:34:20 --> 01:34:25] which tells you how far off the deep end, but anyway, it's just, well everything you're saying
[01:34:25 --> 01:34:31] is just, but you're exactly, you're exactly right with all that. It's just it's difficult to
[01:34:31 --> 01:34:35] convey that to people because there's so many emotions involved, but at the end of the day it's like
[01:34:36 --> 01:34:40] I don't see a whole lot of difference and people on the left and the right anymore. I think we're all
[01:34:40 --> 01:34:46] just like, like you said, we all, we all are trying to just effectively accomplish the same thing,
[01:34:46 --> 01:34:51] just in different ways and it's really easy to get angry at somebody that's on the same level as you
[01:34:51 --> 01:34:54] than somebody that you don't even know exists, which is like what these private equity companies
[01:34:54 --> 01:35:00] and these people in the background that do all, like the, the enemy that, so what's happened is
[01:35:00 --> 01:35:04] is going back to the zebra thing when I think it's happened, it's like especially in politics,
[01:35:04 --> 01:35:09] the reason why Hillary Clinton can be against gay marriage and then four transgender kids in
[01:35:09 --> 01:35:13] a very short period of my lifetime and a whole bunch of other politicians, whether,
[01:35:13 --> 01:35:17] is that they're all just constantly rearranging their stripes, so all the zebras look just alike,
[01:35:17 --> 01:35:22] because as soon as one of them looks a little bit different, you know, like a, it's a great
[01:35:22 --> 01:35:27] like Tulsi Gabbard or whatever, I don't know, there's plenty of people besides that's just the
[01:35:27 --> 01:35:33] first one that comes to mind that's like, you know, trying to be a Democrat and, and upholding
[01:35:33 --> 01:35:37] most of what the Democratic Party would have wanted her to uphold up until very recently,
[01:35:37 --> 01:35:40] but because she didn't rearrange her stripes, it's like, you're dead, but there's a whole
[01:35:40 --> 01:35:46] bunch of more, like her, too, that, that aren't even in politics anymore, but that's, that's the
[01:35:46 --> 01:35:50] way I see it now, is it's like all these people, and so like, even with Big Donny, you know,
[01:35:50 --> 01:35:57] I wonder, like, yeah, I see, I just wonder, even, I just don't trust, it's kind of my Alex
[01:35:57 --> 01:36:01] Jones syndrome, but it's like, no matter how cool somebody seems like that, I think like, man,
[01:36:01 --> 01:36:06] it's, it's him and Hillary really still chit, like, they're probably smoking a fat joint right now,
[01:36:06 --> 01:36:09] this laugh, I don't know, like, you just don't really know, you don't really know, you're just,
[01:36:10 --> 01:36:14] you have to see what you see, and you have to take it in and just hope that you have that somehow
[01:36:14 --> 01:36:18] you have the discernment to know what's true or not, but you really just don't, I mean, even with me,
[01:36:18 --> 01:36:24] man, so much crazy stuff that gets said and done, and I just don't even, when things come out
[01:36:24 --> 01:36:27] about me, then aren't true, I just don't even reply or acknowledge him anymore, I just let him
[01:36:27 --> 01:36:31] exist and their own little space and be part of it, and I've just decided that, again, we're
[01:36:31 --> 01:36:36] just all, we're just in this crazy thing, we're all this stuff happens and it's just, I don't know,
[01:36:36 --> 01:36:41] you can't, the problem is so many people that don't do that, they're not aware of how much influence
[01:36:41 --> 01:36:47] is being peddled onto them, how much, how much their mind, their opinion is being affected by this
[01:36:47 --> 01:36:52] nonsense, on social media, by bots and by all these different things. What you said about the
[01:36:52 --> 01:36:57] zebras and the stripes, so fucking perfect, one of my favorite clips is Hillary Clinton when
[01:36:57 --> 01:37:06] she was running, I think it was 2012, it might have been, when did she, he first became president,
[01:37:06 --> 01:37:14] 2008, right? Obama, it might have been 2008, but she was running and she was more
[01:37:14 --> 01:37:19] MAGA than MAGA, she was talking about the border and about people coming over here, if you want to
[01:37:19 --> 01:37:24] stay, you get a stiff fine, and if you've done anything illegal, you get exported, no questions
[01:37:24 --> 01:37:31] asked, and listen to this, give me this full volume from the beginning, wait till you hear this,
[01:37:31 --> 01:37:38] this is wild. So I think we got to have tough conditions, tell people to come out of the shadows,
[01:37:38 --> 01:37:46] if they've committed a crime, deport them, no questions asked, they're gone. If they, if they've been
[01:37:46 --> 01:37:51] working, and are law abiding, we should say here are the conditions for you staying, you have to
[01:37:51 --> 01:37:57] pay a stiff fine because you came here illegally, you have to pay back taxes, and you have to try to
[01:37:57 --> 01:38:04] learn English, and you have to wait in line. It's like, you have to wait and look, that's so MAGA.
[01:38:05 --> 01:38:10] I mean, but this proves the point that none of that really means they're sitting in the green room
[01:38:10 --> 01:38:14] in the back before that speech, and there's like some stuff for it now, and they're just like,
[01:38:14 --> 01:38:18] oh, I got to try to remember all this crap, like none of that meant anything, you know,
[01:38:18 --> 01:38:21] like none of that, I don't think she even believed when she said it back then, and other of it,
[01:38:21 --> 01:38:26] she thought it was what the country wanted to hear. That's all it is. It's all focus group shit.
[01:38:26 --> 01:38:31] It's all what the country wants to hear, and what the party agrees upon, what the zebras all agree on.
[01:38:31 --> 01:38:36] When you just said that, that's it perfectly, and as it morphs, as it gets into trans kids,
[01:38:36 --> 01:38:40] you got to support trans people in the military, whatever it is, they just all fucking hop in line,
[01:38:40 --> 01:38:45] what flag am I putting in my Twitter? And to go back to go back to what you said at the beginning
[01:38:45 --> 01:38:49] about those kids that are riding, and they don't really even know what they're riding,
[01:38:49 --> 01:38:53] they got the mask on, but they're doing this, and it's like, I guess what I mean is,
[01:38:53 --> 01:39:00] there's a bunch of human beings on Earth, especially now, like in this sort of like American
[01:39:00 --> 01:39:04] culture and all the other sub-series of it, like in Europe and everywhere, so Americanized now,
[01:39:04 --> 01:39:08] but there's all these people who are really angry. It's kind of like, it's the reason why
[01:39:09 --> 01:39:13] you know, there's so many of these videos where they interview like the antifa dudes,
[01:39:13 --> 01:39:17] and they don't really even know why they're not able to talk, they're not really able to articulate
[01:39:17 --> 01:39:20] why they're there, what they believe, they're just there because they want to, they're just there to riot,
[01:39:20 --> 01:39:27] you know, there's this like general anger that I think has dwells in a lot of us towards the
[01:39:27 --> 01:39:32] system that we realize is inefficient and ineffective and rigged, but it's just too complex, at least
[01:39:32 --> 01:39:36] individually, and through the means of the internet for us to identify who our enemies really are,
[01:39:37 --> 01:39:42] and so instead it's like, let's just go, let's just go, let's go catch some shit on fire,
[01:39:42 --> 01:39:45] because at least it feels like we're doing something, even though, but I think like,
[01:39:46 --> 01:39:53] I think there's a lot more in common between the patriotic cosplaying type people who want to,
[01:39:53 --> 01:39:59] who talk all the time about like, you know, that and the people who are like antifa, I actually think
[01:40:00 --> 01:40:01] with the same cloth.
[01:40:01 --> 01:40:04] They just both just don't really realize it.
[01:40:04 --> 01:40:10] But I think like, there is this really amazing sort
[01:40:10 --> 01:40:13] of rebellious spirit of the left that just needs
[01:40:13 --> 01:40:15] to be reintegrated in a society with the right.
[01:40:15 --> 01:40:17] And then it becomes unstoppable.
[01:40:17 --> 01:40:19] And it no longer becomes a left and a right thing.
[01:40:19 --> 01:40:22] But I just don't think, like I give you another great example,
[01:40:22 --> 01:40:28] like when I was younger, I'd go to these some of these
[01:40:28 --> 01:40:29] protests in DC and stuff.
[01:40:29 --> 01:40:31] And I would always stay George Washington University
[01:40:31 --> 01:40:32] with these kids.
[01:40:32 --> 01:40:36] And we were all in our early 20s, probably.
[01:40:36 --> 01:40:39] And we're all very like, at that point,
[01:40:39 --> 01:40:41] there wasn't any like, real political identity to it.
[01:40:41 --> 01:40:43] I don't think those people would have called themselves
[01:40:43 --> 01:40:44] a left back then.
[01:40:44 --> 01:40:46] But you better believe most of them ended up going
[01:40:46 --> 01:40:48] to all the black block and the antifa and the black
[01:40:48 --> 01:40:49] blocks matter.
[01:40:49 --> 01:40:51] And every other protest there was just because they wanted
[01:40:51 --> 01:40:51] to go protest.
[01:40:51 --> 01:40:57] They just are like, it's like, yeah, it's a thing
[01:40:57 --> 01:41:01] of like rebelling against the system.
[01:41:01 --> 01:41:04] It doesn't really matter what part of the system it is
[01:41:04 --> 01:41:06] or if it really even makes any sense, you just know
[01:41:06 --> 01:41:10] that that's, yeah, it's like, I think that's what I mean,
[01:41:10 --> 01:41:11] it's the means of the internet.
[01:41:11 --> 01:41:13] I don't think we'll ever be able to organize all those people
[01:41:13 --> 01:41:15] together in a way that's productive.
[01:41:15 --> 01:41:16] But I do think in real life we can.
[01:41:16 --> 01:41:20] I do think, I do think through, I think music is,
[01:41:20 --> 01:41:22] I think that's why I want to focus mostly on music
[01:41:22 --> 01:41:24] and like trying to influence in and away to where the rich
[01:41:24 --> 01:41:25] don't control it.
[01:41:25 --> 01:41:28] And the rich don't choose what songs we listen to,
[01:41:28 --> 01:41:30] what songs make it on the charts, like we do.
[01:41:30 --> 01:41:31] I think that's the first step.
[01:41:31 --> 01:41:34] I think I actually think music is like, I guarantee you,
[01:41:34 --> 01:41:35] if you look, if there was some way to,
[01:41:35 --> 01:41:38] I'm sure there's some report to be ran where you could see
[01:41:38 --> 01:41:40] how people voted versus what kind of music people listen to.
[01:41:40 --> 01:41:42] And I guarantee you a lot of people who voted differently
[01:41:42 --> 01:41:45] listen to the same exact lyrics and resonate with them.
[01:41:45 --> 01:41:48] Like what is that, like there, that's all I mean.
[01:41:48 --> 01:41:51] Is this, we're just been, we've just been mass distracted
[01:41:51 --> 01:41:53] and miss, and misled, is all like.
[01:41:53 --> 01:41:55] Well, also when you get these kind of organized protests,
[01:41:55 --> 01:41:58] they're all organized with this one thought in mind.
[01:41:58 --> 01:42:04] Like there's unlawful changes in policies
[01:42:04 --> 01:42:07] that's shipping our community back to Mexico.
[01:42:07 --> 01:42:08] And we got to stop this.
[01:42:08 --> 01:42:11] These are all, you know, oligarchs are involved
[01:42:11 --> 01:42:15] and this is a dictatorship and they feel like they're fighting
[01:42:15 --> 01:42:16] against something bad.
[01:42:16 --> 01:42:18] And if they're unenformed and who the fuck
[01:42:18 --> 01:42:21] who's 21 is informed, you know?
[01:42:21 --> 01:42:24] Most people who are young, especially if you're going to college,
[01:42:24 --> 01:42:27] you're around a bunch of other like-minded people
[01:42:27 --> 01:42:29] in an echo chamber and you're all trying
[01:42:29 --> 01:42:33] to like get social credit by being the most woke
[01:42:33 --> 01:42:36] and the most activist, and you're the person who's the most involved,
[01:42:36 --> 01:42:37] and you're helping to organize,
[01:42:37 --> 01:42:39] and you feel like you get a sense of purpose.
[01:42:39 --> 01:42:42] And then there's also the thing of being on the ground
[01:42:42 --> 01:42:44] with a bunch of other people that are moving in a certain direction.
[01:42:44 --> 01:42:48] To me, it, I think it ignites a thing.
[01:42:48 --> 01:42:51] I think there's things inside of us that get ignited.
[01:42:51 --> 01:42:54] And one of them is like, here's the best way to describe
[01:42:54 --> 01:42:55] is like fishing.
[01:42:55 --> 01:42:57] You know when you go fishing,
[01:42:57 --> 01:42:59] I've seen people catch their first fish.
[01:42:59 --> 01:43:02] When that fish gets online, they're cool.
[01:43:02 --> 01:43:04] You get excited, everybody gets excited
[01:43:04 --> 01:43:07] because it's this ancient thing inside of you
[01:43:07 --> 01:43:09] that lets you know you're now successful.
[01:43:09 --> 01:43:12] Your family's going to eat, you caught a fish.
[01:43:12 --> 01:43:14] And it just like sparks it inside of you.
[01:43:14 --> 01:43:15] It does it with bow hunting,
[01:43:15 --> 01:43:18] but for every few people are going to go bow hunting.
[01:43:18 --> 01:43:20] But the other thing that does it with his war
[01:43:20 --> 01:43:22] and protests are like war.
[01:43:22 --> 01:43:24] You're marching, you're all together.
[01:43:24 --> 01:43:25] Who's opposing us?
[01:43:25 --> 01:43:26] Fuck them.
[01:43:26 --> 01:43:27] And you're everyone's all aggressive
[01:43:27 --> 01:43:28] and they're all chanting.
[01:43:28 --> 01:43:33] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[01:43:33 --> 01:43:35] And you think you're doing the right thing.
[01:43:35 --> 01:43:37] You think you're doing the right thing.
[01:43:37 --> 01:43:38] And then you see shit like cops,
[01:43:38 --> 01:43:40] shoot and rubber bullets at reporters.
[01:43:40 --> 01:43:41] And you're like, what the fuck?
[01:43:41 --> 01:43:43] These people are garbage.
[01:43:43 --> 01:43:44] Like how you shoot and a reporter.
[01:43:44 --> 01:43:46] That's not what you're supposed to shoot with them.
[01:43:46 --> 01:43:49] Yeah, but I think the problem now is that it's
[01:43:49 --> 01:43:53] it's too complicated to be able to dissect it and correct it.
[01:43:53 --> 01:43:56] That like, like with these ice protests, though,
[01:43:56 --> 01:43:59] in other words, there's been such a heavily disputed
[01:43:59 --> 01:44:02] and mismanaged protocol of our immigration
[01:44:02 --> 01:44:03] in my entire life.
[01:44:03 --> 01:44:06] So now it's like, you can't now just go in
[01:44:06 --> 01:44:08] and just try to, like that's what's going to happen.
[01:44:08 --> 01:44:09] People are going to protest though
[01:44:09 --> 01:44:10] and you just all of a sudden go in
[01:44:10 --> 01:44:13] and try to just like clean house all it wants.
[01:44:13 --> 01:44:15] It's like we've never even really established
[01:44:15 --> 01:44:18] as a country what it is or because like,
[01:44:18 --> 01:44:20] because most of the people we've listened to
[01:44:20 --> 01:44:22] the last 20 years will say stuff like that
[01:44:22 --> 01:44:24] and whatever year that was 2008
[01:44:24 --> 01:44:27] and now say, gosh, can you imagine if somebody said that now?
[01:44:27 --> 01:44:30] That they would be like, they would be a racist
[01:44:30 --> 01:44:32] and taken off the internet for saying what Hillary said
[01:44:32 --> 01:44:34] on their behalf and to speak English and stuff.
[01:44:34 --> 01:44:35] So it's for sure.
[01:44:35 --> 01:44:37] But there's a big difference in protests
[01:44:37 --> 01:44:39] and organized protests where you're paying people
[01:44:39 --> 01:44:41] and then you're leaving bricks around.
[01:44:41 --> 01:44:44] This is like, it's a bastardization.
[01:44:44 --> 01:44:46] It's a, they've taken over the thing.
[01:44:46 --> 01:44:48] This, the, the virtue of this thing,
[01:44:48 --> 01:44:50] like this part of the first amendment,
[01:44:50 --> 01:44:51] you're right to express yourself.
[01:44:51 --> 01:44:53] The right for the people to get together
[01:44:53 --> 01:44:55] and say, hey, this is not cool
[01:44:55 --> 01:44:58] and they've distorted it with money, like everything else.
[01:44:58 --> 01:45:01] Yeah, and they've used it as a political tool.
[01:45:01 --> 01:45:03] I would think maybe that's happened a lot though,
[01:45:03 --> 01:45:07] even in, in the past with like, civil rights and everything else.
[01:45:07 --> 01:45:10] A lot of that was much more organized than it was made.
[01:45:10 --> 01:45:12] Like I didn't know until just a couple years ago,
[01:45:12 --> 01:45:14] like I've learned the story all through school
[01:45:14 --> 01:45:17] and heard it a million times about Rosa Parks,
[01:45:17 --> 01:45:18] but I didn't realize until a couple years ago
[01:45:18 --> 01:45:21] that she was part of some, I don't know,
[01:45:21 --> 01:45:22] I don't even know what she was part of,
[01:45:22 --> 01:45:23] but she was part of some organization
[01:45:23 --> 01:45:26] and it was like a planned thing.
[01:45:26 --> 01:45:30] I just, I was always taught it like she just spontaneously did it.
[01:45:30 --> 01:45:32] But I think, I think there's just,
[01:45:32 --> 01:45:35] there's every, every like thing in history
[01:45:35 --> 01:45:37] has this whole backstory to it that we don't really know
[01:45:37 --> 01:45:38] much about.
[01:45:38 --> 01:45:40] Most things have been manipulated if they can be manipulated.
[01:45:40 --> 01:45:42] Once they realize they can manipulate people,
[01:45:42 --> 01:45:46] they started, and they probably started that a long time ago.
[01:45:46 --> 01:45:48] I mean, we've talked about it a million times,
[01:45:48 --> 01:45:51] so that's why Smedley Butler, World War, World War is a racket.
[01:45:51 --> 01:45:55] In 1933, you know, Major General Smedley Butler,
[01:45:55 --> 01:45:57] who was, they, they tried to get him
[01:45:57 --> 01:45:59] to overthrow the fucking government with the coup
[01:45:59 --> 01:46:01] and he wouldn't do it and then he writes his book
[01:46:01 --> 01:46:05] about how every single operation he was involved with.
[01:46:05 --> 01:46:06] He thought they were doing this,
[01:46:06 --> 01:46:08] but really they were just making it safe for bankers.
[01:46:08 --> 01:46:10] They're really just overthrowing a government
[01:46:10 --> 01:46:11] and stalling a friendly one.
[01:46:11 --> 01:46:15] It's like it's been going on since they could.
[01:46:15 --> 01:46:17] And back then, it was way easier to pull off
[01:46:17 --> 01:46:18] because there was no internet.
[01:46:18 --> 01:46:20] We could pull up a Hillary Clinton video
[01:46:20 --> 01:46:23] from more than a decade ago and go, look at her.
[01:46:23 --> 01:46:25] She's a pretty maga.
[01:46:25 --> 01:46:27] You could put a fucking red hat on that lady
[01:46:27 --> 01:46:32] and she'd be standing on that stage right next to RFK Junior, you know?
[01:46:32 --> 01:46:34] Yeah, and it's just,
[01:46:34 --> 01:46:36] because there's such an information never loads stuff like that
[01:46:36 --> 01:46:38] will always be forgotten about too soon,
[01:46:38 --> 01:46:39] too for it to make a difference.
[01:46:40 --> 01:46:43] She could have been Trump's vice president back then.
[01:46:43 --> 01:46:44] Yeah.
[01:46:44 --> 01:46:45] Like no bullshit.
[01:46:45 --> 01:46:48] She would have been like queen mom of Trump land.
[01:46:48 --> 01:46:51] They would be people with Hillary Clinton flags
[01:46:51 --> 01:46:54] flying behind their pickup trucks with her
[01:46:54 --> 01:46:56] with like two fists in the air with a maga hat on.
[01:46:56 --> 01:46:57] I'm not bullshit.
[01:46:57 --> 01:47:00] But I remember even back then, like, well, you know,
[01:47:00 --> 01:47:02] the one, that's what made me fall in love with comedy
[01:47:02 --> 01:47:04] was Norm McDonald and like his whole bit
[01:47:04 --> 01:47:07] about the Clinton's and stuff and getting on the view
[01:47:07 --> 01:47:09] and frying all them up and stuff.
[01:47:09 --> 01:47:12] But even back then, I remember they were trying to,
[01:47:12 --> 01:47:14] like, I guess he got kicked off a Saturday night live
[01:47:14 --> 01:47:15] because of that, right?
[01:47:15 --> 01:47:16] And all was it, because of the Clinton's,
[01:47:16 --> 01:47:18] or it might have been because of his product
[01:47:18 --> 01:47:19] because he's too funny.
[01:47:19 --> 01:47:20] There was something else.
[01:47:20 --> 01:47:25] Yeah, but there's Adam.
[01:47:25 --> 01:47:27] Yeah, there was one of the funniest people of all time
[01:47:27 --> 01:47:30] and his weekend update that thing that he would do
[01:47:30 --> 01:47:31] was fucking fantastic.
[01:47:31 --> 01:47:33] His franta, he was the best ever at it.
[01:47:33 --> 01:47:34] He was so good.
[01:47:34 --> 01:47:38] And the jokes were so, he would go so out there.
[01:47:38 --> 01:47:40] Back when you could, you know?
[01:47:40 --> 01:47:42] And if that's what got him kicked off a Saturday night live,
[01:47:42 --> 01:47:45] great, makes him even more of a legend.
[01:47:45 --> 01:47:46] I think more.
[01:47:46 --> 01:47:49] Yeah, I think that's what's important about,
[01:47:49 --> 01:47:52] I'm not a fan of all the real crazy,
[01:47:52 --> 01:47:54] vulgar humor sometimes and stuff.
[01:47:54 --> 01:47:56] Like, I'm more of a norm type of comedy guy.
[01:47:56 --> 01:47:58] Like, I like the more goofy stuff
[01:47:58 --> 01:48:00] that's not like constantly talking about
[01:48:00 --> 01:48:02] penises and stuff, but like, you know,
[01:48:02 --> 01:48:04] or whatever, like, whatever it is,
[01:48:04 --> 01:48:06] say, and everything else, but it's really important
[01:48:06 --> 01:48:08] that all that stuff does exist
[01:48:08 --> 01:48:10] just because of the idea, if I think it's important
[01:48:10 --> 01:48:12] that there's this place that exists here
[01:48:12 --> 01:48:14] and Austin that freedom of speech will always be.
[01:48:14 --> 01:48:18] And even if, you know, it's like it's such a critical thing,
[01:48:18 --> 01:48:19] especially now more than ever.
[01:48:19 --> 01:48:21] I think critical for everybody, even if you don't agree
[01:48:21 --> 01:48:24] with it, and that's so hard for people to recognize.
[01:48:24 --> 01:48:26] When people don't have a voice and someone has a voice
[01:48:26 --> 01:48:28] and that voice is different than their opinion,
[01:48:28 --> 01:48:31] they want to shut it down, they want to silence it.
[01:48:31 --> 01:48:34] And they want to elevate their voice nature,
[01:48:34 --> 01:48:39] just pure natural instincts that human beings have.
[01:48:39 --> 01:48:41] And you've got to resist that because you've got to realize
[01:48:41 --> 01:48:43] you don't want that used on you, right?
[01:48:43 --> 01:48:45] Well, then don't use it on other people.
[01:48:45 --> 01:48:46] Yeah, well, everyone's guilty.
[01:48:46 --> 01:48:48] Like, I went, when I was at the ARC,
[01:48:48 --> 01:48:50] where we spoke of that thing in London,
[01:48:50 --> 01:48:53] there was a talk we went to, I think, the next night
[01:48:53 --> 01:48:55] that was about freedom of speech.
[01:48:55 --> 01:48:57] And I can't remember the, I can't remember
[01:48:57 --> 01:48:58] who all was speaking there.
[01:48:58 --> 01:49:00] It was some people that I should probably remember.
[01:49:00 --> 01:49:05] But yeah, but they were talking about, it was a group
[01:49:06 --> 01:49:08] that was defending people in Europe
[01:49:08 --> 01:49:10] that were like being arrested and stuff
[01:49:10 --> 01:49:12] for things they had reposted online,
[01:49:12 --> 01:49:15] which is really important, like they're arresting people
[01:49:15 --> 01:49:17] for political things that they put online in Europe
[01:49:17 --> 01:49:21] and like not even giving them very obscure reasoning
[01:49:21 --> 01:49:25] as to why in some cases they won't even tell them
[01:49:25 --> 01:49:26] what they're arresting them for.
[01:49:26 --> 01:49:28] And so like the cause of what these people are doing
[01:49:28 --> 01:49:29] is very important, but the whole time
[01:49:30 --> 01:49:32] they're referring to it as the woke mind virus,
[01:49:32 --> 01:49:34] which is yeah, sure, funny, put in a bid or whatever,
[01:49:34 --> 01:49:38] but God like, no, what it is is it's like the government
[01:49:38 --> 01:49:42] using this one specific thing out of a list of things
[01:49:42 --> 01:49:44] that they could as part of this moral high ground
[01:49:44 --> 01:49:46] to arrest people for speaking out against.
[01:49:46 --> 01:49:48] Not because it has nothing to do with anything
[01:49:48 --> 01:49:50] on the left of the rights, the fact that the state
[01:49:50 --> 01:49:52] would love for people to not be allowed
[01:49:52 --> 01:49:53] to criticize anything, because then that means
[01:49:53 --> 01:49:55] they can't criticize them.
[01:49:55 --> 01:49:55] 100%.
[01:49:55 --> 01:49:57] But by them saying woke mind virus,
[01:49:57 --> 01:49:59] every five minutes while they're talking about it,
[01:49:59 --> 01:50:00] it just in.
[01:50:00 --> 01:50:09] Immediately polarizes half the people who they need to get on board in order to stop it, which is the left to it's like, I don't know, there's just, I don't know, I think I might try to,
[01:50:09 --> 01:50:13] one of these days, I might just try to give the old thing a run and see it, but I really think I could.
[01:50:14 --> 01:50:21] It would be, it would probably be a run for press, it would probably be, it would probably end in like a nuclear war, but I think we could do,
[01:50:21 --> 01:50:27] I think it'd be pretty interesting, I think you're going to run for office, if you will fuck that, no,
[01:50:28 --> 01:50:31] I've no, I'm not on the same page, I don't know,
[01:50:31 --> 01:50:33] vermin supreme, call me up, no he's kidding,
[01:50:33 --> 01:50:39] I don't think I would, I might do like a governor run somewhere or something or a mayor, maybe I'll start with mayor, maybe that's a good one.
[01:50:39 --> 01:50:45] It's like a terrible job dude, don't do it, I would say don't do it, but if you have to do it, do it,
[01:50:45 --> 01:50:47] I mean, someone should do it that's like you.
[01:50:47 --> 01:50:54] I just remember in my whole life, like since I was a kid, people were like, man, what would happen if just we got some regular dude in there and like all this,
[01:50:54 --> 01:50:57] it's just like, I don't know, to get immediately disillusioned,
[01:50:57 --> 01:51:05] you'd realize the entanglements that exist, and I think it's impossible to navigate, I think once you get in there, you're like, holy shit.
[01:51:06 --> 01:51:10] And when I talk to people that are in this administration now that weren't before,
[01:51:10 --> 01:51:16] that realize like all the paperwork and red tape and bureaucracy and all the different departments,
[01:51:16 --> 01:51:22] all the people that are controlling these departments and all the fucking resistance you have to any change,
[01:51:22 --> 01:51:28] and all the people that don't want to give you the information that you're asking for, and it gets wild and exhausting.
[01:51:28 --> 01:51:34] And you're dealing with a machine that's been operating pretty much unchecked for decades.
[01:51:34 --> 01:51:36] Well, let's check them out, get me old check.
[01:51:36 --> 01:51:37] Look what they did to Elon.
[01:51:37 --> 01:51:38] He tried to check them out.
[01:51:38 --> 01:51:41] The chairman will not see, I mean, it's like,
[01:51:41 --> 01:51:43] well, do you think was there?
[01:51:43 --> 01:51:47] I'm not well right on any of this, this is like, this is actually something I wanted to ask you about,
[01:51:47 --> 01:51:51] at one point or another anyway, was your take on like the Elon Trump situation,
[01:51:51 --> 01:51:54] but, you know, I, um, apparently they're making up.
[01:51:54 --> 01:51:55] Do you think things are cool now?
[01:51:55 --> 01:51:58] The supposedly, you know, on conversation on the phone.
[01:51:58 --> 01:52:02] The argument, but the argument behind it was that they felt like Trump wasn't letting Elon,
[01:52:02 --> 01:52:04] see, I don't, I don't know what to think of.
[01:52:04 --> 01:52:09] I really don't know what to think of any of that situation or Elon in general, and I just say,
[01:52:09 --> 01:52:14] I just, it really fascinated me that it seemed like they were both using
[01:52:14 --> 01:52:18] doge for different reasons, maybe, or they had different motivations behind it.
[01:52:18 --> 01:52:24] But what if, what if it was like a genuine, what if there was genuine audits done on everything,
[01:52:24 --> 01:52:26] and like, what if all that stuff did get uncovered?
[01:52:26 --> 01:52:29] And what if somebody wasn't scared to just release all that stuff in the consequences of it?
[01:52:29 --> 01:52:31] Like, people do deserve the truth.
[01:52:31 --> 01:52:33] Like, well, they've released some of it, right?
[01:52:33 --> 01:52:35] So we know a lot about USAID now.
[01:52:35 --> 01:52:36] We know what that was.
[01:52:36 --> 01:52:39] We know what crazy programs are in place.
[01:52:39 --> 01:52:45] We know, through Mike Benz's work, where the way he describes USAID is doing things that are too dirty for the CIA.
[01:52:46 --> 01:52:52] He describes it being used as for regime change, but under the name AID, it seems like it's just AID.
[01:52:52 --> 01:52:56] Oh, we're helping people, but this agency for international development is what it really stands for.
[01:52:57 --> 01:52:59] So there's that that's been dismantled.
[01:53:00 --> 01:53:01] The thing is they're not spending less money.
[01:53:01 --> 01:53:03] They're spending more money.
[01:53:03 --> 01:53:06] There's been like a trillion dollars on the Pentagon.
[01:53:06 --> 01:53:11] It's the whole thing is kind of nuts, because nobody wants to stop spending money.
[01:53:11 --> 01:53:15] Nobody wants to lose their job, and they're all in a position where they have influence.
[01:53:15 --> 01:53:18] And there's thousands of different points of influence.
[01:53:18 --> 01:53:23] And if you're the president or the vice president or any of these fucking people,
[01:53:24 --> 01:53:25] it's a very difficult road.
[01:53:25 --> 01:53:29] The one of the things that I felt was the most important was Bobby Kennedy.
[01:53:29 --> 01:53:35] Because Bobby Kennedy getting in there, he was determined to find out what is the root cause
[01:53:35 --> 01:53:38] of America's massive health crisis that we're all facing.
[01:53:38 --> 01:53:40] Like, why are we having this?
[01:53:40 --> 01:53:45] Why do we have different toxins that are in our foods that are banned in Europe?
[01:53:45 --> 01:53:50] Why are we allowing the use of these different things that we know are terrible for the body?
[01:53:50 --> 01:53:54] You know, why is there not greater scrutiny on these pharmaceutical drug corporations?
[01:53:54 --> 01:53:58] Why are they not, you know, why are they able to lie and get away with it?
[01:53:58 --> 01:54:03] And prescribe things for people that don't need them, and not be responsible for the health
[01:54:03 --> 01:54:06] consequence of these things, and that this needs to be cleaned up.
[01:54:06 --> 01:54:07] And so that's what he's doing right now.
[01:54:08 --> 01:54:09] I'm very happy.
[01:54:09 --> 01:54:13] And I hope that he can really make meaningful changes, because it seems like he is.
[01:54:13 --> 01:54:18] He fired the 17 people that were the head of the vaccine schedule.
[01:54:18 --> 01:54:19] And he's hired a bunch of new people.
[01:54:19 --> 01:54:21] They're all very qualified.
[01:54:21 --> 01:54:24] And one of them being Robert Malone.
[01:54:24 --> 01:54:28] Robert Malone, the guy that everybody said, was a cook that I got in trouble for.
[01:54:28 --> 01:54:32] Initially, for having on my podcast, when they were trying to, you know,
[01:54:32 --> 01:54:35] when fucking Neil Young was trying to get me removed from Spotify.
[01:54:35 --> 01:54:36] This is over Robert Malone.
[01:54:36 --> 01:54:42] Robert Malone, who owns nine patents on the creation of mRNA vaccine technology.
[01:54:42 --> 01:54:46] Certifiable genius, like unquestionably, they were calling him a cook.
[01:54:46 --> 01:54:47] This guy's a cook.
[01:54:47 --> 01:54:51] A guy who took the vaccine and had a horrible reaction, they were calling him a cook.
[01:54:51 --> 01:54:56] So that guy being a part of this administration, being a part of the, you know,
[01:54:56 --> 01:54:59] make America healthy again, movement, very important.
[01:54:59 --> 01:55:03] All that's does very important for everybody, not Republicans, not Democrats.
[01:55:03 --> 01:55:07] If there's any area where we should be bipartisan on, it's that.
[01:55:07 --> 01:55:13] And realizing that corporations have taken advantage of loopholes and of a bunch of different
[01:55:13 --> 01:55:17] creepy laws that allowed them to poison you.
[01:55:17 --> 01:55:20] And you're getting poison and you're addicted to this poison.
[01:55:20 --> 01:55:21] And there's a way out of this.
[01:55:22 --> 01:55:28] Well, he's, he's kind of where I got the inspiration for the call idea from, you know, he,
[01:55:28 --> 01:55:30] no, well, he, he and I actually met.
[01:55:30 --> 01:55:34] He came out to my, he came out to the property where we filmed Richmond and all and I met him.
[01:55:34 --> 01:55:36] This was before he got linked up with Trump.
[01:55:36 --> 01:55:36] He was still running.
[01:55:36 --> 01:55:39] This is during all that and he was, he was still running for himself.
[01:55:39 --> 01:55:44] But we had a long conversation about this concept for a healing center, which is like this
[01:55:44 --> 01:55:49] thing that he's been kind of like, as a part of all this, which is like, which is kind of the
[01:55:49 --> 01:55:53] idea of people going out in the nature and like learning how to grow food and learning how to
[01:55:53 --> 01:56:00] like, because in this, in this never ending a business of chaos or everything's changing so fast
[01:56:00 --> 01:56:06] and nothing, you know, nature is, a nature has been affected by that through like some, you know,
[01:56:06 --> 01:56:11] through chemicals and technology and other things, but for the most part, it's all the systems
[01:56:11 --> 01:56:16] in nature, all the organization there and all that stuff is sort of like the last thing that's
[01:56:16 --> 01:56:20] untouched by man, you know, when you go out on two or three hundred acres and you just sit there
[01:56:20 --> 01:56:25] and you're watching the water go by, it's like, you just sort of, you take everything that we've
[01:56:25 --> 01:56:32] talked about like all this, these are all very complex, like, just crazy, century, thousands of
[01:56:32 --> 01:56:36] year-long things that man kind of done. But meanwhile, nature just sort of exists and does it's
[01:56:36 --> 01:56:42] thing and it's like, it's sort of a way to compartmentalize all this monstrosity and the one little
[01:56:42 --> 01:56:46] thing and realize that there is other, there is a reality outside of the reality that like modern
[01:56:46 --> 01:56:54] society has constructed us to exist in 24-7. That's 100%. 100%. 100%. Like, gosh, dude, that's the only thing
[01:56:54 --> 01:56:58] that saves me is like, especially being a little bit probably a little bit too introverted for
[01:56:58 --> 01:57:03] this job position, you know, going out on tour even for a week in or two or like,
[01:57:03 --> 01:57:06] dude, by the time Sunday comes and we get through this and these two mother ship shows,
[01:57:07 --> 01:57:11] we have a, we got West Virginia next weekend, but I'll spend this whole week, I probably won't
[01:57:11 --> 01:57:15] talk to anybody except for like immediate family, you know, I'll just have my, I'll just go
[01:57:15 --> 01:57:19] sit out in the woods with dogs and just watch the birds chirp and all that, but it's amazing.
[01:57:19 --> 01:57:25] There's something really important about that that I want to, I want to, I want to understand like,
[01:57:25 --> 01:57:30] you take, if you can take two or three hundred acres, like, what can you plant on it that brings in
[01:57:30 --> 01:57:36] the types of nature that benefit human beings, the most, like, I want to conduct studies on like
[01:57:36 --> 01:57:41] everything from birds to plants to wildlife to different types, like, how do you put a human being
[01:57:41 --> 01:57:47] who is so screwed up in the most optimal condition to heal and to fix? Like, as it's obviously
[01:57:47 --> 01:57:51] not the case, like, you're not going to go to a mental institution or, and I'm not even suggesting
[01:57:51 --> 01:57:55] for people who should be in a mental institution, I just mean like, you know, people who like a guy,
[01:57:55 --> 01:57:59] I know who you mentioned mushrooms and stuff, but there's a guy, I know, like, that's in the
[01:57:59 --> 01:58:03] Marines who's dealing with PTSD, like, how do you get him into a spot where he can just go out and
[01:58:03 --> 01:58:07] roll, you know, like, you can't, it's hard to, it's hard to fix that part of your brain living in a
[01:58:07 --> 01:58:13] city or living in a suburb and not having that, like, so that's, you know, so yeah, it's just like this
[01:58:13 --> 01:58:18] crazy dream I have where, like, it's sort of a, it's a way to rebel against all of this without
[01:58:18 --> 01:58:22] rebelling, it's just creating a better way to do it, but imagine if you like, this is like the
[01:58:22 --> 01:58:26] pilot program for this thing, where it's this sort of outdoor amphitheater and it's like,
[01:58:26 --> 01:58:32] very immersive in a nature and you can, and you can, like, re, re unlock these parts of your
[01:58:32 --> 01:58:35] brain, you talked about that are sort of very primitive and to us, and then, and then just emulated
[01:58:35 --> 01:58:40] over a period of time, like, so I'm doing these shows where they're, they're, they're non-profit,
[01:58:40 --> 01:58:44] and the idea is just to go into an area that hasn't had music that's in an A or B ticketing market,
[01:58:44 --> 01:58:47] do a show there, build them a blueprint, whether it's on a main street or in a farm,
[01:58:47 --> 01:58:51] field or whatever, but just somewhere where live nation and ticket master can't touch it,
[01:58:51 --> 01:58:55] build them a blueprint with, like, ingress egress promotions, how to sell the show, where to put
[01:58:55 --> 01:58:59] the stage, how to set everything up, here's all the vendors to use, and then give them this blueprint
[01:58:59 --> 01:59:03] where they can do it over and over and over again and just build, like, these sort of sanctuaries
[01:59:03 --> 01:59:08] that exist all over the country that can't be, like, molested and preyed upon by all those big companies
[01:59:08 --> 01:59:13] in all their crap, and I think inherently by doing that through, like, music and public speaking,
[01:59:13 --> 01:59:18] and other things, those spaces will almost serve as, like, like, the way that communities thrive,
[01:59:18 --> 01:59:24] again, and the way people reconnect, and I joke and say that, like, everyone, every human being,
[01:59:24 --> 01:59:29] like, music and food, and socializing, at least a little bit, and if you don't, you're probably
[01:59:29 --> 01:59:34] a robot, and I don't want you there anyway, kind of a thing, you know, but, like, so that's,
[01:59:34 --> 01:59:37] that's in an nutshell, but that all was inspired by Bobby's sort of idea for this healing
[01:59:37 --> 01:59:41] center that he talked about. I think it's a place over in Italy that he used as a reference
[01:59:41 --> 01:59:45] of, um, he had a relative go to, and, like, they were able to work with, like, a leather and do all the
[01:59:45 --> 01:59:50] stuff on a vineyard, I think, and it, like, it had a, there's a lot of, you know, we know very little
[01:59:50 --> 01:59:53] about the human mind, that's why psychedelics are still illegal, and so, and there's so much
[01:59:53 --> 01:59:58] misunderstanding and misconception and just confusion even there, because, I mean, like, our brains are
[01:59:58 --> 02:00:00] so, and infinitely calm.
[00:00:00 --> 00:00:06] The joke, Rogan, experience.
[00:00:06 --> 00:00:10] Train my day, Joe Rogan, podcast, my night, all day.
[00:00:10 --> 00:00:15] And we're up, my friend, how are you?
[00:00:15 --> 00:00:16] Good to see you.
[00:00:16 --> 00:00:17] Long time no talk.
[00:00:17 --> 00:00:18] Yeah, brother.
[00:00:18 --> 00:00:19] Yeah.
[00:00:19 --> 00:00:20] Are you doing good?
[00:00:20 --> 00:00:21] Good.
[00:00:21 --> 00:00:25] I remember, like, towards the last, the end of the last time I was here.
[00:00:25 --> 00:00:26] You said, oh, yeah.
[00:00:26 --> 00:00:28] We'll probably see you again in a couple years.
[00:00:28 --> 00:00:31] And I was just looking around like, yeah, I'll never see any of this again.
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:33] You're back quicker than you thought.
[00:00:33 --> 00:00:34] Yeah.
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:37] Bro, that new song is Fire.
[00:00:37 --> 00:00:38] Thanks.
[00:00:38 --> 00:00:39] Yeah.
[00:00:39 --> 00:00:41] I played that song about 20 times in the green room.
[00:00:41 --> 00:00:46] And the first time I played it, everybody just sat around and went, oh, shit.
[00:00:46 --> 00:00:50] It was so funny that, um, yeah, I didn't expect the song.
[00:00:50 --> 00:00:52] Well, you know, I didn't, I wasn't the one.
[00:00:52 --> 00:00:54] I guess it was Adam that sent it.
[00:00:54 --> 00:00:56] I don't even know how you got a hold of the song originally.
[00:00:56 --> 00:00:57] Yeah.
[00:00:57 --> 00:00:58] I sent it to me originally.
[00:00:58 --> 00:00:59] Yeah.
[00:00:59 --> 00:01:05] I sent it to him like, um, yeah, just kind of just to get his opinion of it or whatever.
[00:01:05 --> 00:01:06] And he's like, I got it.
[00:01:06 --> 00:01:08] He's like, do you mind if I share this around?
[00:01:08 --> 00:01:09] And I was like, yeah, go ahead.
[00:01:09 --> 00:01:11] Well, the first time I heard it was in the green room.
[00:01:11 --> 00:01:14] And the green room has a killer sound system.
[00:01:14 --> 00:01:18] So we put it on the Bluetooth and cranked it in all of us.
[00:01:18 --> 00:01:21] There's like 10 dudes in that room going, oh, shit.
[00:01:21 --> 00:01:22] Oh, shit.
[00:01:22 --> 00:01:25] Some of those lies like, oh, shit.
[00:01:25 --> 00:01:26] Yeah.
[00:01:27 --> 00:01:29] What makes that song different, I guess,
[00:01:29 --> 00:01:33] than anything I've done or than a lot of music now is that we're, um,
[00:01:33 --> 00:01:37] we tried to, like, do it the way Leonard Skinner or somebody would back in this,
[00:01:37 --> 00:01:40] where we're all just in the house and there's no, like, man,
[00:01:40 --> 00:01:43] there's so much editing that goes into music now on the back end and stuff.
[00:01:43 --> 00:01:45] And with this, we're just like in there doing it.
[00:01:45 --> 00:01:49] And, you know, try to keep it as real as possible.
[00:01:49 --> 00:01:52] Like, um, you know, there's no, there's no click tracks.
[00:01:52 --> 00:01:53] There's no real editing.
[00:01:53 --> 00:01:55] It's just kind of like we're all just in this house.
[00:01:55 --> 00:01:59] I mean, it's, it was, is the worst timing they've recorded, but, um,
[00:01:59 --> 00:02:03] that was, that January 5th, 6th, 7th window was the only time
[00:02:03 --> 00:02:04] that everybody can meet up, you know, Billy,
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:06] contraris on the fiddle and everybody.
[00:02:06 --> 00:02:08] And because he, he tours with Ricky Skags,
[00:02:08 --> 00:02:10] and he's kind of all over the place.
[00:02:10 --> 00:02:11] So that was like our time to meet.
[00:02:11 --> 00:02:15] So a couple of days before we all went to West Virginia to record
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:19] in my house up there, the, um, this like terrible storm they were calling for.
[00:02:19 --> 00:02:21] It's like the worst one since the 90s supposedly,
[00:02:21 --> 00:02:22] or that's what Draven says.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:25] But, so we got all the snow, all the size.
[00:02:25 --> 00:02:30] So, um, so yeah, we used a side by side in a Jeep to haul everything up and down.
[00:02:30 --> 00:02:33] It was like, just all we could do to get up and down to the house.
[00:02:33 --> 00:02:35] And then it's right as soon as we get everything plugged in,
[00:02:35 --> 00:02:37] ready to go the power knocks out.
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:42] And, uh, I was like, we were all just so discouraged.
[00:02:42 --> 00:02:44] And, um, luckily there, you know, there's a lows,
[00:02:44 --> 00:02:46] not terribly far away.
[00:02:46 --> 00:02:49] And they had one, they had like a Honda inverter generator
[00:02:49 --> 00:02:51] that was like safe to plug everything into.
[00:02:51 --> 00:02:55] You know, like a, where the waves aren't going to mess everything up.
[00:02:55 --> 00:02:58] And, um, so yeah, we, you know, we recorded this on,
[00:02:58 --> 00:02:59] while on a generator.
[00:02:59 --> 00:03:03] So you have to worry about the waves of the generally the sound of the generator.
[00:03:03 --> 00:03:04] Or like, is that what it is?
[00:03:04 --> 00:03:05] No, like the electrical.
[00:03:05 --> 00:03:06] Yes, yes.
[00:03:06 --> 00:03:09] Like plugging all of that expensive equipment in to just like a,
[00:03:09 --> 00:03:12] uh, yeah, a generator that's on an inverter, like the voltage,
[00:03:12 --> 00:03:14] like goes up and down, I guess, sir.
[00:03:14 --> 00:03:15] I don't know.
[00:03:15 --> 00:03:16] That's all above my pay grade.
[00:03:16 --> 00:03:20] But we had to find one that was like safe to plug all that equipment into, you know.
[00:03:21 --> 00:03:25] Well, it, maybe that's something in the song, too.
[00:03:25 --> 00:03:28] You know, like maybe that you're trapped in a storm.
[00:03:28 --> 00:03:30] But that's a scary ass song, dude.
[00:03:30 --> 00:03:32] It's a scare.
[00:03:32 --> 00:03:35] I can't wait for the, yeah, see, I hadn't put a lot of new music out
[00:03:35 --> 00:03:41] because, um, well, I think back to even when I was here last time
[00:03:41 --> 00:03:44] and before we did the episode and all, um,
[00:03:44 --> 00:03:47] walking around on the sidewalk out in front of the hotel with driving
[00:03:47 --> 00:03:51] up, other people arguing that I needed to just catch up from Richmond and roll
[00:03:51 --> 00:03:55] and not make this into a long term thing because I just, um,
[00:03:55 --> 00:03:58] well, dude, I just don't, some people thrive in this environment,
[00:03:58 --> 00:03:59] like everybody looking at them.
[00:03:59 --> 00:04:02] But I, to me, it's just like, uh, so it just, it kind of takes,
[00:04:02 --> 00:04:05] it kind of takes a little bit out of me putting new music out.
[00:04:05 --> 00:04:08] And so, you know, after Richmond only had this two new songs,
[00:04:08 --> 00:04:11] I really just wanted to let everything kind of slow down.
[00:04:11 --> 00:04:15] And I could still maybe do five or ten shows a year and make a little bit,
[00:04:15 --> 00:04:17] but I wasn't trying to be like a superstar.
[00:04:17 --> 00:04:19] I didn't want everybody just to be,
[00:04:19 --> 00:04:21] I didn't want to be stuck in that spot.
[00:04:21 --> 00:04:23] I was when I was at Richmond where everybody's just, like,
[00:04:23 --> 00:04:26] obsessing over stuff and so I kind of just tried to let it die.
[00:04:26 --> 00:04:28] And then it, you know, it wouldn't.
[00:04:28 --> 00:04:33] It was like, the streams kept continuing and people were still messaging me and emailing
[00:04:33 --> 00:04:36] and the shows were still selling out and I just realized, like,
[00:04:36 --> 00:04:40] I don't know, you know, I believed everybody that said,
[00:04:40 --> 00:04:43] this kid's got 15 minutes of fame and whatever and I would have been
[00:04:43 --> 00:04:45] during when Richmond blew up.
[00:04:45 --> 00:04:47] I would have been one of those guys who would have been like,
[00:04:47 --> 00:04:48] oh, that's stupid guy.
[00:04:48 --> 00:04:50] You know, like, I would have been a hater too.
[00:04:50 --> 00:04:53] So I was almost like rooting for them, like, yeah.
[00:04:53 --> 00:04:55] You know, because you got to think, man,
[00:04:55 --> 00:04:58] the first check from Richmond was $800,000.
[00:04:58 --> 00:05:01] Like, I could have lived a long time off of that money, you know,
[00:05:01 --> 00:05:03] like, I don't need a whole lot of, like, that was great.
[00:05:03 --> 00:05:06] You know, that was a decade or more of work for me easily.
[00:05:06 --> 00:05:08] And when I was like, I was like, heck, yeah,
[00:05:08 --> 00:05:09] I'm good.
[00:05:09 --> 00:05:10] I'll just take it, you know.
[00:05:10 --> 00:05:14] And anyway, I say all that to say that now, it's like,
[00:05:14 --> 00:05:17] I'm going to at least just hit it good one more time.
[00:05:17 --> 00:05:20] I've got, we've got six songs recorded now to come
[00:05:20 --> 00:05:22] after scoring full debt or all, like,
[00:05:22 --> 00:05:24] I'm pretty proud of them, they're good.
[00:05:24 --> 00:05:27] And so I'm going to put those out and then who knows after that.
[00:05:27 --> 00:05:29] But let me tell you what's going to happen.
[00:05:29 --> 00:05:32] You've got a relationship with those people now, man.
[00:05:32 --> 00:05:33] They love you.
[00:05:33 --> 00:05:34] Yeah.
[00:05:34 --> 00:05:38] It's just your mission in life.
[00:05:38 --> 00:05:41] You know, you just got handed a wild hand of cards.
[00:05:41 --> 00:05:43] And this is your deck of cards.
[00:05:43 --> 00:05:47] You know, your deck of cards is, or your hand of cards is,
[00:05:47 --> 00:05:51] you put this song out, this authentic song.
[00:05:51 --> 00:05:52] That's very simple.
[00:05:52 --> 00:05:54] In this time, we're nothing simple.
[00:05:54 --> 00:05:57] In this time where everything's confusing and,
[00:05:57 --> 00:06:00] you don't know who's telling the truth.
[00:06:00 --> 00:06:02] The news is lying to you.
[00:06:02 --> 00:06:04] Everything is being funded.
[00:06:04 --> 00:06:05] Nothing's organic.
[00:06:06 --> 00:06:09] It's half the fucking traffic on social media's bots.
[00:06:09 --> 00:06:10] It leased.
[00:06:10 --> 00:06:11] Yeah.
[00:06:11 --> 00:06:12] Politicians are lying.
[00:06:12 --> 00:06:14] Everybody's confused.
[00:06:14 --> 00:06:16] People are simple for politicians.
[00:06:16 --> 00:06:20] They're getting paid to repeat talking points on television.
[00:06:20 --> 00:06:22] And on podcasts and all over social media.
[00:06:22 --> 00:06:24] So when someone comes on with something like that,
[00:06:24 --> 00:06:27] it's just that dude telling you how he feels.
[00:06:27 --> 00:06:28] Yeah.
[00:06:28 --> 00:06:29] Real raw.
[00:06:29 --> 00:06:32] You know, I remember we had that conversation on the phone.
[00:06:32 --> 00:06:34] And I was like, if you can do that, you can do that again.
[00:06:34 --> 00:06:36] You don't, they don't need anybody else.
[00:06:36 --> 00:06:39] You don't need these motherfuckers who want you to cash out.
[00:06:39 --> 00:06:43] All these, they're, they're doing that because they think that you're gollable.
[00:06:43 --> 00:06:48] They think that you're naive in the ways of the entertainment music business.
[00:06:48 --> 00:06:55] The first fucking live show you ever performed was a giant sold-out show at a state fair.
[00:06:55 --> 00:06:56] You know, crazy that is?
[00:06:56 --> 00:06:57] This is your first watch.
[00:06:57 --> 00:06:58] Yeah.
[00:06:58 --> 00:07:02] That very first show was actually, it was even more amateur than that.
[00:07:02 --> 00:07:04] It was at a farm market.
[00:07:04 --> 00:07:07] It wasn't even a, there weren't even any tickets.
[00:07:07 --> 00:07:11] It was just like, so it's crazy how it all, it just, it goes back to when I,
[00:07:11 --> 00:07:14] I still believe, just as much now as I did the last time I was here about it.
[00:07:14 --> 00:07:17] And I definitely won't bug everybody too much with all my hokey,
[00:07:17 --> 00:07:18] poke, religious stuff either.
[00:07:18 --> 00:07:20] Like I definitely want to read a little bit up before we go.
[00:07:20 --> 00:07:24] But I do believe it was just, it was all too perfectly timed.
[00:07:24 --> 00:07:28] But I had actually picked that date out at the farm market before Richmond blew up.
[00:07:28 --> 00:07:31] That was going to be my first time playing live either way.
[00:07:31 --> 00:07:32] That date.
[00:07:32 --> 00:07:34] It was like August the 12th, I think.
[00:07:34 --> 00:07:37] I had booked it back in July with that Morris farm market.
[00:07:37 --> 00:07:41] I was going to get 200 bucks and go play for like, it was like two and a half hours.
[00:07:41 --> 00:07:42] Like seriously.
[00:07:42 --> 00:07:46] And in that time, that's what, so like I already had that date picked in.
[00:07:46 --> 00:07:50] Yeah, it was just that a farm market and got kind of near the beach and other banks.
[00:07:50 --> 00:07:52] And they say like 12,000 people showed up.
[00:07:52 --> 00:07:55] That was the very first one.
[00:07:55 --> 00:07:56] Yeah.
[00:07:56 --> 00:08:00] And I just, I remember even then, like I just expected everybody.
[00:08:00 --> 00:08:02] I just expected everybody to sing Richmond and that was going to be it.
[00:08:02 --> 00:08:04] And it'd be cool when I'd go back to work the next week.
[00:08:04 --> 00:08:07] But it was like even in that crowd at that very first show, all the other songs.
[00:08:07 --> 00:08:09] They knew the words too, too.
[00:08:09 --> 00:08:11] And I was like, this is like something, you know.
[00:08:11 --> 00:08:17] But the important thing too is that the important thing to take away from this.
[00:08:17 --> 00:08:18] And I said this during Richmond.
[00:08:18 --> 00:08:22] But you know, it was like, take me out of it.
[00:08:22 --> 00:08:27] The fact that people can now choose what they want and push it to the top,
[00:08:27 --> 00:08:30] even in a system that's rigged where there is bots.
[00:08:30 --> 00:08:33] And there's mass marketing money going in the songs.
[00:08:33 --> 00:08:37] And like labels spend a million dollars on their own song to get it up the label.
[00:08:37 --> 00:08:38] Yeah.
[00:08:38 --> 00:08:42] The fact that people can just decide they like something and just shoot it up to the top.
[00:08:42 --> 00:08:45] Like people need to realize how much power and influence they have.
[00:08:45 --> 00:08:47] At least for a short period in time in society.
[00:08:47 --> 00:08:50] It's like the stars are aligned where we can kind of.
[00:08:50 --> 00:08:51] It's funny.
[00:08:51 --> 00:08:56] Technology like can only develop on the backs of people using it.
[00:08:56 --> 00:09:01] And so like AI and and all of this over the years social media like all the back end of that.
[00:09:01 --> 00:09:06] It's been it's all that information being sort of extracted from us.
[00:09:06 --> 00:09:10] Like you think about like the like the way in a Tesla car rides on the road and it's watching you drive.
[00:09:10 --> 00:09:14] And you're like it's like reading your analytics so it can learn how to drive better.
[00:09:14 --> 00:09:19] We know AI that's the only reason why they let everybody use AI is so it can make the AI.
[00:09:19 --> 00:09:22] It's the user input that's what makes it.
[00:09:22 --> 00:09:30] And so for a very short period in time it's like the stars are aligned where they're having to like while they're sucking all the humanity out of us to put into this AI.
[00:09:30 --> 00:09:36] We also have full access to it and like so we can do like even in the even in the music business.
[00:09:36 --> 00:09:44] You know everything that the label used to help exclusive control over like the publicity and the marketing and the digital streaming service relationships.
[00:09:44 --> 00:09:50] Like all that stuff is now just alicard to anybody like you don't need the you don't need those big companies all that stuff.
[00:09:50 --> 00:10:00] You can just go and hire a really good social media person and you can work with the good music distributor without having to sign anything or give any of your rights up and right now the people have the power is.
[00:10:00 --> 00:10:01] but I mean, for like a very short period of time,
[00:10:01 --> 00:10:04] but this should just be a reminder of that.
[00:10:04 --> 00:10:07] This song being able to go up into the iTunes charts,
[00:10:07 --> 00:10:10] even with stuff, with way bigger audiences
[00:10:10 --> 00:10:11] with all kinds of marketing reach.
[00:10:11 --> 00:10:13] You know, the fact that this can just organically go
[00:10:13 --> 00:10:15] into the iTunes charts like that.
[00:10:15 --> 00:10:18] And people, you know, it's just, that's the thing.
[00:10:18 --> 00:10:20] That's the thing I always take away from it
[00:10:20 --> 00:10:21] is just like damn, dude.
[00:10:21 --> 00:10:24] If we could just get organized, even for like two or three years,
[00:10:24 --> 00:10:25] we could just fix everything.
[00:10:25 --> 00:10:29] Like, the people really do have the power, at least right now,
[00:10:29 --> 00:10:32] for a short window of time, but we really do.
[00:10:32 --> 00:10:34] I mean, we, but people have to understand
[00:10:34 --> 00:10:36] that we are all in this together,
[00:10:36 --> 00:10:40] and that there's organizations that want to drive us apart.
[00:10:40 --> 00:10:41] And the way to work out our differences
[00:10:41 --> 00:10:45] is having conversations and negotiations
[00:10:45 --> 00:10:47] and figuring out how to work it out.
[00:10:47 --> 00:10:49] It's not lighting cop cars on fire.
[00:10:49 --> 00:10:52] Like, this is, you know?
[00:10:52 --> 00:10:55] But the spirit of those, like, not to defend any of that crap,
[00:10:55 --> 00:10:57] but I just, that rebellious nature
[00:10:57 --> 00:10:58] and us is important, too, though.
[00:10:58 --> 00:11:02] It just has to be, it has to be directed correctly.
[00:11:02 --> 00:11:04] You shouldn't be burdening way,
[00:11:04 --> 00:11:07] most while holding a Mexican flag, trying not to get said
[00:11:07 --> 00:11:08] back to Mexico.
[00:11:08 --> 00:11:10] I mean, you're confusing the fuck out of me, dog.
[00:11:10 --> 00:11:13] Like, who is your presser?
[00:11:13 --> 00:11:15] Is it the electric car?
[00:11:15 --> 00:11:19] Is it the country, which, you know, you want to stay,
[00:11:19 --> 00:11:21] but you're holding a flag of another country?
[00:11:21 --> 00:11:23] Like, why you wearing a mask?
[00:11:23 --> 00:11:24] Are you proud of this?
[00:11:24 --> 00:11:26] Do you not want to get arrested?
[00:11:26 --> 00:11:27] What are we doing?
[00:11:27 --> 00:11:28] Are you scared of COVID?
[00:11:28 --> 00:11:29] Like, I want to know.
[00:11:29 --> 00:11:35] Well, it goes back to what you said about mass manipulation
[00:11:35 --> 00:11:38] and also like, we've all sort of lost our identity.
[00:11:38 --> 00:11:40] That's why politics has become so prevalent
[00:11:40 --> 00:11:44] and like, the way people represent themselves to other people.
[00:11:44 --> 00:11:49] And like, you know, as our culture and our tradition
[00:11:49 --> 00:11:53] and like sort of the knowledge of where our families
[00:11:53 --> 00:11:54] and all of that stuff comes from,
[00:11:54 --> 00:11:56] like, we're just sort of all,
[00:11:56 --> 00:11:57] we're just little boats out in the big ocean
[00:11:57 --> 00:11:59] and we're looking for somewhere to,
[00:11:59 --> 00:12:01] we're looking for some kind of identity
[00:12:01 --> 00:12:03] to reach out and grab and politics.
[00:12:03 --> 00:12:05] They make politics so easy to reach out and grab
[00:12:05 --> 00:12:06] and make just like in the same way
[00:12:06 --> 00:12:09] that people just absorb themselves into sports.
[00:12:09 --> 00:12:09] Exactly.
[00:12:09 --> 00:12:11] You know, they're at way out of shape,
[00:12:11 --> 00:12:13] but they like, they refer to their sports team
[00:12:13 --> 00:12:16] as we, like, all our defense did really does that all the time.
[00:12:16 --> 00:12:17] We won.
[00:12:17 --> 00:12:19] Talk about a college, where I'm from.
[00:12:19 --> 00:12:21] Some college, where he's from.
[00:12:21 --> 00:12:21] Well, that's up.
[00:12:21 --> 00:12:23] Maybe.
[00:12:23 --> 00:12:24] Get out of here.
[00:12:24 --> 00:12:25] Maybe if he's from there,
[00:12:25 --> 00:12:26] then it doesn't count.
[00:12:26 --> 00:12:27] I'm just fucking around.
[00:12:27 --> 00:12:28] Yeah.
[00:12:28 --> 00:12:30] I'm not a team sports guy.
[00:12:30 --> 00:12:32] You know, I'm a combat sports guy
[00:12:32 --> 00:12:33] and I would never say we won.
[00:12:33 --> 00:12:37] Like a tomorrow, Oosmara, beat somebody I never say we won.
[00:12:37 --> 00:12:39] You know, come on, I would call me up.
[00:12:39 --> 00:12:42] But the fuck are you saying man, we, you know what I didn't camp?
[00:12:42 --> 00:12:44] You know, I mean, rounds I spark, you know?
[00:12:44 --> 00:12:47] Yeah, all the punches he took.
[00:12:47 --> 00:12:48] It's so crazy.
[00:12:48 --> 00:12:50] It was a group of guys you can say we.
[00:12:50 --> 00:12:52] But that's, I see that, like,
[00:12:52 --> 00:12:54] I just see that becoming more and more prevalent
[00:12:54 --> 00:12:58] where there's not like, I don't know.
[00:12:58 --> 00:13:02] It's sort of just like, it's kind of even, even to expand
[00:13:02 --> 00:13:03] on the thought of it.
[00:13:03 --> 00:13:06] It's even like the way that now we've all just sort of,
[00:13:06 --> 00:13:08] we're all in these subcategories of the way we would be
[00:13:08 --> 00:13:09] if we were in prison.
[00:13:09 --> 00:13:11] We're all like, you know, like in the same way
[00:13:11 --> 00:13:14] that when we use the word black and white to describe,
[00:13:14 --> 00:13:17] like, how many different types of white and black
[00:13:17 --> 00:13:19] are there that all just get merged?
[00:13:19 --> 00:13:22] It's like, it's like, creates this maybe like group identity
[00:13:22 --> 00:13:24] that's a lot easier to control.
[00:13:24 --> 00:13:27] Like, sure, well, and then it shifts over time.
[00:13:27 --> 00:13:29] Like, my family wasn't white.
[00:13:29 --> 00:13:30] My family was Italian.
[00:13:30 --> 00:13:32] They were, they were disparage when they first came
[00:13:32 --> 00:13:34] to America from Europe.
[00:13:34 --> 00:13:36] And my grandfather just told me terrible stories
[00:13:36 --> 00:13:37] wouldn't happen to him when he was a boy,
[00:13:37 --> 00:13:39] living in America as an Italian.
[00:13:39 --> 00:13:42] They treated them the same way terribly racist people
[00:13:42 --> 00:13:45] or treating people from Guatemala that's naked here.
[00:13:45 --> 00:13:46] And it's the same kind of thing.
[00:13:46 --> 00:13:50] Then after a while, they sort of integrated it and now white.
[00:13:50 --> 00:13:52] Yeah, now you're just a white person.
[00:13:52 --> 00:13:54] That's just a regular white.
[00:13:54 --> 00:13:57] But it's easy now and they're like in big public narrative
[00:13:57 --> 00:14:01] and stuff to it's a lot easier to accuse you
[00:14:01 --> 00:14:04] and 30 other different nationalities of people
[00:14:04 --> 00:14:06] who were all very culturally different and unique
[00:14:06 --> 00:14:08] and just call all of you white people.
[00:14:08 --> 00:14:10] And then pick the worst thing that one of those nationalities
[00:14:10 --> 00:14:12] did and just cast it among the whole group.
[00:14:12 --> 00:14:16] But it happens with that with every ethnicity, every identity.
[00:14:16 --> 00:14:18] The goal is to like put everyone in the world
[00:14:18 --> 00:14:20] and one of three or four buckets.
[00:14:20 --> 00:14:22] And then hopefully figure out how to just put all of them
[00:14:22 --> 00:14:23] into one bucket eventually.
[00:14:23 --> 00:14:26] It's like it's just it's so much easier to control two
[00:14:26 --> 00:14:28] or three different types of people than it is 30 or 40
[00:14:28 --> 00:14:30] or 100 or 1000, you know?
[00:14:30 --> 00:14:33] Which is also I think why they never fix the problems
[00:14:33 --> 00:14:35] that AL are inner cities.
[00:14:35 --> 00:14:38] They want to keep that conflict.
[00:14:38 --> 00:14:39] I really believe that.
[00:14:39 --> 00:14:43] Because if somebody wanted to have a better stronger economy,
[00:14:43 --> 00:14:45] the first thing you would do is you want more people
[00:14:45 --> 00:14:46] in the workforce.
[00:14:46 --> 00:14:49] So you'd want less people that are disenfranchised,
[00:14:49 --> 00:14:53] completely out of society, felons, all that stuff.
[00:14:53 --> 00:14:56] That doesn't do anything but cost the country money, right?
[00:14:56 --> 00:14:59] Unless you have private prisons.
[00:14:59 --> 00:15:01] Now private prisons, those people become a business.
[00:15:01 --> 00:15:05] And then that business contributes to the escalation of laws.
[00:15:05 --> 00:15:08] And they want to make sure that law is staying place
[00:15:08 --> 00:15:10] because that way their businesses always fall.
[00:15:10 --> 00:15:11] They have plenty of customers.
[00:15:11 --> 00:15:13] Their customers are human beings
[00:15:13 --> 00:15:16] that they turn into batteries to generate money.
[00:15:16 --> 00:15:17] That's what it is.
[00:15:17 --> 00:15:19] Like those people, every person they have in there,
[00:15:19 --> 00:15:23] they get more money, which is wild.
[00:15:23 --> 00:15:24] It's wild that we allow that.
[00:15:24 --> 00:15:28] But then it's also like keeping a certain amount of crime
[00:15:28 --> 00:15:31] in certain areas, ensures that you're always
[00:15:31 --> 00:15:33] going to have debates over law enforcement.
[00:15:33 --> 00:15:36] You're always going to have conversations over disenfranch...
[00:15:36 --> 00:15:40] We need DEI, we need this, we need quotas.
[00:15:40 --> 00:15:44] We need to hire more people of this sort of that,
[00:15:44 --> 00:15:47] ignoring the fact that there's a lot of these things
[00:15:47 --> 00:15:50] especially with universities are the most racist,
[00:15:50 --> 00:15:52] especially towards Asians.
[00:15:52 --> 00:15:54] The racist is fucked towards Asians.
[00:15:54 --> 00:15:56] There's lawsuits about it.
[00:15:56 --> 00:16:00] Harvard is that's still going on the Harvard lawsuit
[00:16:00 --> 00:16:04] where they specifically made their application process,
[00:16:04 --> 00:16:06] like the whole acceptance process,
[00:16:06 --> 00:16:07] more difficult for Asians,
[00:16:07 --> 00:16:09] because they were kicking too much ass.
[00:16:09 --> 00:16:12] They had too many Asian people that were willing
[00:16:12 --> 00:16:15] to fucking work their ass off, study 12 hours a day,
[00:16:15 --> 00:16:18] get straight A, he's like, man, as too many of these folks.
[00:16:18 --> 00:16:19] We got to make it tough for her.
[00:16:19 --> 00:16:22] What did they do to make it more difficult, specifically?
[00:16:22 --> 00:16:23] They attached a bunch of things.
[00:16:23 --> 00:16:25] I believe the argument is they attached a bunch
[00:16:25 --> 00:16:28] of things like social stuff,
[00:16:28 --> 00:16:33] like how much do you engage in activism,
[00:16:33 --> 00:16:38] how often are you involved in social activities on campus?
[00:16:38 --> 00:16:41] What are the things are you doing other than just
[00:16:41 --> 00:16:43] pure academic work?
[00:16:43 --> 00:16:46] They're trying to slow them down.
[00:16:46 --> 00:16:48] They're literally trying to slow them down.
[00:16:48 --> 00:16:52] Yeah, that's another great example, too,
[00:16:52 --> 00:16:57] like even just that they can blank it, Asian like that,
[00:16:57 --> 00:17:02] as such a, it's Indian, it's Chinese, there's a lot of,
[00:17:02 --> 00:17:05] but yeah, people that come from a hard place
[00:17:05 --> 00:17:06] are willing to work hard.
[00:17:06 --> 00:17:07] That's the difference.
[00:17:07 --> 00:17:10] And the problem with meritocracy,
[00:17:10 --> 00:17:12] is that some other fuckers will go for it.
[00:17:12 --> 00:17:14] And if you get a whole country of people going for it,
[00:17:14 --> 00:17:16] that gets scary for the people that just want to take naps.
[00:17:16 --> 00:17:18] It's the same psychology that goes in,
[00:17:18 --> 00:17:21] like in a lot of the smaller Apple Action towns,
[00:17:21 --> 00:17:25] like where we recorded was really close to Bramwell, West Virginia,
[00:17:25 --> 00:17:29] but if you look at, even if you look at Bramwell, West Virginia,
[00:17:29 --> 00:17:31] and their recent political history, like the last mayor
[00:17:31 --> 00:17:34] they had, she embossled money from the town,
[00:17:34 --> 00:17:37] and there was like, you know, and this is in a very small tent,
[00:17:37 --> 00:17:41] like, so government corruption exists like everywhere.
[00:17:41 --> 00:17:44] And it almost is like, maybe in those big cities,
[00:17:44 --> 00:17:47] I understand definitely that I think things are intentionally
[00:17:47 --> 00:17:49] neglected like to create chaos.
[00:17:49 --> 00:17:52] And they create this like you said, this need for more resources
[00:17:52 --> 00:17:55] and more, but it's also just that maybe a lot of those people
[00:17:55 --> 00:17:57] that are in positions are just very spineless
[00:17:57 --> 00:17:59] and self-centered, and like, they don't even care
[00:17:59 --> 00:18:00] that people are dying in their streets.
[00:18:00 --> 00:18:03] They're worried about the money that can be made
[00:18:03 --> 00:18:04] in the ego and the power of it.
[00:18:04 --> 00:18:07] It goes back to kind of what I said in that ARC speech,
[00:18:07 --> 00:18:08] about lack of leadership.
[00:18:08 --> 00:18:11] I just see that like, if we had people in big cities
[00:18:11 --> 00:18:14] or in small Appalachian towns that had like a real backbone
[00:18:14 --> 00:18:17] to them and like, and they were in a real position
[00:18:17 --> 00:18:19] of like leadership where they wanted to fix things,
[00:18:19 --> 00:18:21] that a lot of that stuff would get addressed and covered,
[00:18:21 --> 00:18:23] but we just don't have the right people in power,
[00:18:23 --> 00:18:26] maybe even just what it is, even in people don't say government.
[00:18:26 --> 00:18:28] The right people don't run.
[00:18:28 --> 00:18:29] They don't want that job, man.
[00:18:29 --> 00:18:30] They don't want that smoke.
[00:18:30 --> 00:18:31] They don't want people attacking them.
[00:18:31 --> 00:18:33] They don't want any of it.
[00:18:33 --> 00:18:35] The right people are the people that don't want to be president.
[00:18:35 --> 00:18:38] It's almost, it's almost like they've made these positions
[00:18:38 --> 00:18:39] only appealing to people who are like,
[00:18:39 --> 00:18:42] sort of criminal, associate pass their criminals.
[00:18:42 --> 00:18:43] Yeah, real, real.
[00:18:43 --> 00:18:45] Like who the fuck wants to run everything?
[00:18:45 --> 00:18:47] Do you gotta be crazy?
[00:18:47 --> 00:18:49] I don't even like running my whole house.
[00:18:49 --> 00:18:50] I don't like having employees.
[00:18:50 --> 00:18:52] It's too much, it's too much responsible.
[00:18:52 --> 00:18:54] What do you think would happen if just some normal people
[00:18:54 --> 00:18:56] ran the country, though, like just some average?
[00:18:56 --> 00:18:58] Just like, what if me and you just went and ran the,
[00:18:58 --> 00:19:00] would of me if you ran for president, what would happen?
[00:19:00 --> 00:19:03] If you killed, would you put in a fucking good vertical?
[00:19:03 --> 00:19:05] They would definitely be able to hit my big head.
[00:19:05 --> 00:19:06] That's for sure.
[00:19:06 --> 00:19:07] My head's not that little either.
[00:19:07 --> 00:19:09] You want a cigar?
[00:19:09 --> 00:19:10] Yeah, let's do it.
[00:19:10 --> 00:19:11] Get on that big dog.
[00:19:11 --> 00:19:13] Well, the, I smoked a cigar with a guy one time.
[00:19:13 --> 00:19:17] That, what happened?
[00:19:17 --> 00:19:18] This is the second one.
[00:19:18 --> 00:19:19] It ended up all on the internet.
[00:19:19 --> 00:19:20] Yeah.
[00:19:20 --> 00:19:22] This is your second cigar ever?
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:22] Yeah.
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:24] I was keeping it running for a minute.
[00:19:24 --> 00:19:26] Yeah, I was just pulling it.
[00:19:26 --> 00:19:29] The real cigar guys, they want you to do that first.
[00:19:29 --> 00:19:31] You kind of baked the outside.
[00:19:31 --> 00:19:35] I think they like it's a, like I'm in high school and it's like a fat joint.
[00:19:35 --> 00:19:37] Oh, imagine joint like this.
[00:19:37 --> 00:19:42] I'm guaranteed to do some people out there, some rappers rolling, blunts this thing.
[00:19:42 --> 00:19:46] You got to do it this way, are they getting mad at you?
[00:19:46 --> 00:19:48] Yeah, this is really good.
[00:19:48 --> 00:19:49] Yeah.
[00:19:49 --> 00:19:53] With how much your privacy is being vaded online, VPNs are no longer just a nice
[00:19:53 --> 00:19:54] thing to have.
[00:19:54 --> 00:19:56] It's a necessity.
[00:19:56 --> 00:19:59] Some people think, I don't need a VPN because I have nothing to hide.
[00:19:59 --> 00:20:03] But that's exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:20:00 --> 00:20:05] Actual data brokers want you to think because their profits depend on you, having nothing
[00:20:05 --> 00:20:06] to hide.

[00:21:07 --> 00:21:09] Shout out to foundation cigars.
[00:21:09 --> 00:21:14] Well, hey, I did smoke a smoke, tap a block, a block in mild with Chris Davis and from
[00:21:14 --> 00:21:15] the Davis and Brothers.
[00:21:15 --> 00:21:16] Well, we're on time.
[00:21:16 --> 00:21:18] So I guess that counts as a cigar.
[00:21:18 --> 00:21:19] Kind of a cigar.
[00:21:19 --> 00:21:23] We're going to switch your sweets, they kind of count as cigars.
[00:21:23 --> 00:21:25] I have a talking about swishers sweets.
[00:21:25 --> 00:21:29] I have a friend of mine that I ride side by side with a lot named Jeremy.
[00:21:29 --> 00:21:31] And that's all he smokes or swishers sweets.
[00:21:31 --> 00:21:35] And that's like, is anytime I see him, I'm like, yo, what's up, swishers sweet?
[00:21:35 --> 00:21:38] So I ended up hitting him up on Instagram, swishers sweet.
[00:21:38 --> 00:21:40] And I said, hey, I got a friend of mine.
[00:21:40 --> 00:21:42] I was like, well, you just sent him some merchants.
[00:21:42 --> 00:21:46] And they totally did, like, he got this whole, he got like all these shirts and hats.
[00:21:46 --> 00:21:49] And so he's the only guy I know that smokes them, but he's like all day smoking them.
[00:21:49 --> 00:21:51] He's a, he was in the Marines and stuff.
[00:21:51 --> 00:21:52] And he's out now.
[00:21:52 --> 00:21:56] Just like rides a boat around all day and hangs, he's like, let's just dream life now.
[00:21:56 --> 00:21:57] And smoke swishers sweets.
[00:21:57 --> 00:22:00] So I wonder what percentage of swishers sweets get sliced open for blunts?
[00:22:02 --> 00:22:04] It's got to be 50, right?
[00:22:04 --> 00:22:05] Jamie higher.
[00:22:06 --> 00:22:07] 60% of it.
[00:22:07 --> 00:22:09] So like five or 75%.
[00:22:10 --> 00:22:13] Jeremy's the only guy I know who really smokes them without putting weed in him or anything.
[00:22:13 --> 00:22:15] He's like, he's like some, yeah.
[00:22:16 --> 00:22:17] Is he inhaled them?
[00:22:17 --> 00:22:18] Yeah, bro.
[00:22:19 --> 00:22:22] Ron White does that with them little tiny Ron White.
[00:22:22 --> 00:22:23] Those little tiny cigars.
[00:22:23 --> 00:22:24] But those things called again, Jamie.
[00:22:24 --> 00:22:25] We have a bunch of them.
[00:22:26 --> 00:22:27] Like, well, let's take a relos or something.
[00:22:27 --> 00:22:28] Yeah, he brought me a case of them.
[00:22:28 --> 00:22:31] Did I ever tell you their, my Ron White story?
[00:22:31 --> 00:22:32] No, I don't think so.
[00:22:32 --> 00:22:32] Did you?
[00:22:33 --> 00:22:34] I'm going to mess it all up, but that's okay.
[00:22:34 --> 00:22:37] Because that's what this is for is the messed stuff up.
[00:22:38 --> 00:22:42] So it was the night we recorded, gosh, you my head is like spinning out from this thing.
[00:22:42 --> 00:22:43] This is crazy.
[00:22:44 --> 00:22:47] The night that we recorded the day that we recorded the podcast that night.
[00:22:48 --> 00:22:52] There's only went to the mothership of the first time because Tom Sager invited me in.
[00:22:53 --> 00:22:58] So we're sitting in there in the green room, Ron White's there and Tom and a bunch
[00:22:58 --> 00:23:01] of people, William Montgomery, and I got to meet all these really cool people that night.
[00:23:01 --> 00:23:05] And so Tom was like, man, you ought to get up at the end of our set and do a couple songs.
[00:23:06 --> 00:23:08] And we only had one guitar.
[00:23:08 --> 00:23:12] And I really wanted my guitar, Joey, you know, the guy from the, he's in the scornful video, Joey Davis.
[00:23:12 --> 00:23:17] I wanted him to get up there and get to do it with me and Ron's like, well, I got a guitar in my house.
[00:23:17 --> 00:23:21] But, and dude, he's going to, he's supposed to be getting on stage to do a set.
[00:23:21 --> 00:23:23] Like, less than an hour, you know, 45 minutes.
[00:23:24 --> 00:23:32] So him and Joey get in his car and they run every red light from his house and back and go and get Ron White's guitar.
[00:23:32 --> 00:23:33] And that's what we use for our second.
[00:23:33 --> 00:23:35] 15 minutes away. That was such a risky move.
[00:23:36 --> 00:23:38] Yeah, like he said they flew there and back.
[00:23:38 --> 00:23:40] So you guys performed on stage at the mothership.
[00:23:40 --> 00:23:44] Those are the first time on musical acted ever performed there supposedly.
[00:23:44 --> 00:23:50] Yeah, 100% and except for back when it was a musical venue, I mean, Steve Ray Vaughn performed.
[00:23:50 --> 00:23:54] You saw the photos that we have in the tunnel, Steve Ray Vaughn performing there.
[00:23:54 --> 00:23:56] I think it was 83. He was there.
[00:23:56 --> 00:24:03] I think if, I think even by the end of this weekend, we will be able to really have a good blueprint for sound in there again.
[00:24:03 --> 00:24:10] Like, it's a, it's a small room, but I think it would just sound, you could really have an immersive listen and space for people to like.
[00:24:11 --> 00:24:13] Just such a cool spot that maybe do music now.
[00:24:13 --> 00:24:14] Oh, yeah.
[00:24:14 --> 00:24:16] No, I think it would be a great spot to do music.
[00:24:16 --> 00:24:20] It's just, we're always packed with comedians.
[00:24:20 --> 00:24:21] You know, we don't we do it for someone like you for a while.
[00:24:21 --> 00:24:24] It could be a lot, yeah, it could be like every once in a while.
[00:24:24 --> 00:24:27] Like, I love the idea of it doing it being like a live recorded thing.
[00:24:27 --> 00:24:33] Because my favorite music to listen to is the live version of almost anything, any way of people.
[00:24:33 --> 00:24:37] And it would be cool to go back and, I mean, our plan with this, we're going to record
[00:24:37 --> 00:24:46] We'll record Friday and Saturday night and my plan is to put out some kind of mothership live at the mothership and have some of the money go back to the Humane Society.
[00:24:46 --> 00:24:48] Oh, that's awesome.
[00:24:48 --> 00:24:55] That's being recorded and to see what happens, but even if we just get a couple songs out of it or something and put them out.
[00:24:55 --> 00:24:56] Oh, that's badass.
[00:24:56 --> 00:24:57] But yeah, I like that.
[00:24:57 --> 00:24:58] I really like the Austin Humane Society.
[00:24:58 --> 00:25:03] They, I was looking at all their, they got like some really funny dogs and stuff on there, too.
[00:25:03 --> 00:25:07] But I, I, I think it's cool getting to do some of them.
[00:25:07 --> 00:25:10] Yeah, I can't go to those places. I would have a hundred dogs.
[00:25:10 --> 00:25:12] They got this one dog on their website.
[00:25:12 --> 00:25:14] I should have, I should have sent it to you, but I don't know.
[00:25:14 --> 00:25:17] Maybe Jamie can find it, but it's like, there's this one like older dog.
[00:25:17 --> 00:25:19] I think he's at Chihuahua or something.
[00:25:19 --> 00:25:21] But he's got this real funny name like Buddy or Poppy or something.
[00:25:21 --> 00:25:23] But he's like the most like, he doesn't have any teeth.
[00:25:23 --> 00:25:24] His tongue's hanging out.
[00:25:24 --> 00:25:27] It's like, that's my, I could just take him home with me.
[00:25:27 --> 00:25:28] Buddy or something.
[00:25:28 --> 00:25:30] I've had a bunch of rescue dogs in my life.
[00:25:31 --> 00:25:33] Um, there's a thing.
[00:25:33 --> 00:25:34] There's like a relationship.
[00:25:34 --> 00:25:36] You have with them is different than in the other dog.
[00:25:36 --> 00:25:40] Like they fucking, they're so, they love you so much.
[00:25:40 --> 00:25:41] There's so happy rescue them.
[00:25:41 --> 00:25:44] Like they know that you rescued them.
[00:25:44 --> 00:25:46] Whereas my dog Marshall, he has no idea.
[00:25:46 --> 00:25:48] He's like living the best life.
[00:25:48 --> 00:25:49] He just like everyone's my friend.
[00:25:49 --> 00:25:50] Yeah.
[00:25:50 --> 00:25:53] He has, uh, he's never fucking growl that a person in his life.
[00:25:53 --> 00:25:55] He's nothing but sweet.
[00:25:55 --> 00:25:57] Think about how lucky you got to be to be Joe Rogan's dog.
[00:25:57 --> 00:25:58] That's pretty cool.
[00:25:58 --> 00:26:00] Like what's the odds that I don't have a dog?
[00:26:00 --> 00:26:01] It might have a dog like him.
[00:26:01 --> 00:26:02] Yeah.
[00:26:02 --> 00:26:03] He's the best dog ever.
[00:26:03 --> 00:26:05] Yeah, no, he's like a little human.
[00:26:05 --> 00:26:06] He's like a human.
[00:26:06 --> 00:26:07] Like we have conversations.
[00:26:07 --> 00:26:10] Like he knows like not just words.
[00:26:10 --> 00:26:14] He knows like when I'm saying something like what to do.
[00:26:14 --> 00:26:17] Like he, me and that dog are like blocked in.
[00:26:17 --> 00:26:18] It's wild.
[00:26:18 --> 00:26:19] He's the best.
[00:26:19 --> 00:26:23] He's just all love, like for everybody that comes over.
[00:26:23 --> 00:26:25] Like when people come over the studio and he's here,
[00:26:25 --> 00:26:26] he just does a circle.
[00:26:26 --> 00:26:28] He's like, I'm your friend.
[00:26:28 --> 00:26:30] Then it looks like I'm your friend.
[00:26:30 --> 00:26:32] It just goes around and he sees you.
[00:26:32 --> 00:26:34] The first thing he does is flop on his back.
[00:26:34 --> 00:26:36] I know you want to rub my belly.
[00:26:36 --> 00:26:37] Come on.
[00:26:37 --> 00:26:37] Yeah.
[00:26:38 --> 00:26:41] He's just so used to be and just loved dogs.
[00:26:41 --> 00:26:46] Yeah, I just got a, um, why had, you know, I had the three, I had three dogs.
[00:26:46 --> 00:26:48] And then I lost my white shepherd.
[00:26:48 --> 00:26:50] Like right after we got off a tour, he got bone cancer.
[00:26:50 --> 00:26:53] And he was gone within like a month or a month and a half.
[00:26:53 --> 00:26:55] No, it was a really important thing that we should probably tell people about right now.
[00:26:55 --> 00:26:57] And we're talking about cancer.
[00:26:57 --> 00:26:59] Stop feeding your dog process food.
[00:26:59 --> 00:27:01] I know it's expensive.
[00:27:01 --> 00:27:04] But if you can get it, get yourself your dog real food.
[00:27:04 --> 00:27:07] There's companies like farmers dog.
[00:27:07 --> 00:27:09] That's what you use, right?
[00:27:09 --> 00:27:10] Farmers dog.
[00:27:10 --> 00:27:15] And they'll send you like real food and you feed your dog real food.
[00:27:15 --> 00:27:19] It's like real human grade meat and vegetables.
[00:27:19 --> 00:27:20] Your dog will be way better off.
[00:27:20 --> 00:27:22] Just like you would be way better off.
[00:27:22 --> 00:27:27] Anything that can sit on a shelf for six months and not rot.
[00:27:27 --> 00:27:28] It's not good for you.
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:28] Yeah.
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:30] It just sustains them, you know.
[00:27:30 --> 00:27:35] And then, you know, obviously your dogs are running around drinking out of puddles.
[00:27:35 --> 00:27:38] And, you know, what fucking toxins they're exposed?
[00:27:38 --> 00:27:38] I need a lot.
[00:27:38 --> 00:27:41] Like horseshit and stuff, too, they're obsessed with your food.
[00:27:41 --> 00:27:44] But you're going to get a healthier dog if you feed them real food.
[00:27:44 --> 00:27:45] That's all I'm saying.
[00:27:45 --> 00:27:49] I'm not saying it's secured to all it is, but man, it fixed my dog quick.
[00:27:49 --> 00:27:52] Marshall was starting to get a little chubby and we're trying to lessen his food.
[00:27:52 --> 00:27:55] But he was always hungry and I was like this sucks.
[00:27:55 --> 00:28:00] And then we found out the company that I'm using is Maeve, M-A-E-V.
[00:28:00 --> 00:28:03] And they sell you frozen food and he eats it frozen.
[00:28:03 --> 00:28:07] And it's just me and vegetables and he's like fucking loves it.
[00:28:07 --> 00:28:13] And he gobbles it up and he lost the body weight, his coat looked better, he had way more energy.
[00:28:13 --> 00:28:18] I'm like, of course, he's eating real food instead of eating some processed bullshit that's
[00:28:18 --> 00:28:19] filled with preservatives.
[00:28:19 --> 00:28:21] You could sit on a fucking shelf for it.
[00:28:21 --> 00:28:25] Like, if you only ate protein bars all day,
[00:28:25 --> 00:28:28] long and nothing but protein bars, he'd probably get sick.
[00:28:28 --> 00:28:30] How was that thing just sitting there?
[00:28:30 --> 00:28:33] Like, how can you just live off it?
[00:28:33 --> 00:28:35] Plus you got to get tired eating the same thing every day.
[00:28:35 --> 00:28:37] Yeah, that too.
[00:28:37 --> 00:28:38] Yeah.
[00:28:38 --> 00:28:41] Like at this point, I mean, I feel like for your dog, he might as well live a pretty cool life.
[00:28:42 --> 00:28:44] He's got, you know, he's Joe Rogan's dog.
[00:28:44 --> 00:28:47] He can't just be in regular dog food anymore.
[00:28:47 --> 00:28:48] I uh, people don't know though.
[00:28:48 --> 00:28:50] They think dog food is what you give dogs.
[00:28:50 --> 00:28:51] That's the problem.
[00:28:51 --> 00:28:56] Like, they need to understand, like, dogs are just like any other animal, like human beings.
[00:28:57 --> 00:29:01] What they eat has a giant effect on their overall physical health.
[00:29:01 --> 00:29:02] Yeah.
[00:29:02 --> 00:29:05] Yeah, I've been feeding my eggs.
[00:29:05 --> 00:29:07] We've got a bunch of land birds now in meat birds.
[00:29:07 --> 00:29:08] Oh, that's nice.
[00:29:08 --> 00:29:09] But they'll, they just eat raw eggs.
[00:29:09 --> 00:29:13] How long do your meat birds live before you whack them?
[00:29:15 --> 00:29:20] So we just, I just, I've got some now that are about two weeks old and they'll be gone,
[00:29:21 --> 00:29:23] they'll be gone before it starts to cool off.
[00:29:23 --> 00:29:23] It's quick.
[00:29:25 --> 00:29:28] I want to say like two and a half months with them.
[00:29:28 --> 00:29:30] They get, they get to the point where they get so fat.
[00:29:30 --> 00:29:32] They actually can't hold themselves up anymore.
[00:29:32 --> 00:29:33] That is so crazy.
[00:29:33 --> 00:29:34] Yeah.
[00:29:34 --> 00:29:35] Because I don't have meat birds.
[00:29:35 --> 00:29:36] I have egg laying hands.
[00:29:36 --> 00:29:38] And these little ladies just run around all day long.
[00:29:38 --> 00:29:40] You just run around your own loose.
[00:29:40 --> 00:29:40] Yeah.
[00:29:40 --> 00:29:43] My mom, my mom, my, my, my, my, yeah.
[00:29:43 --> 00:29:47] Yeah, I do, I do the chicken tractors, but then I will let them out during the day,
[00:29:47 --> 00:29:48] some two just so they can run around.
[00:29:48 --> 00:29:49] Yeah.
[00:29:49 --> 00:29:51] It's good for them, makes the eggs healthier.
[00:29:51 --> 00:29:52] But they're hilarious to watch too.
[00:29:52 --> 00:29:53] They're just great.
[00:29:53 --> 00:29:57] My friend who runs, uh, he, he has, uh, meat ones.
[00:29:57 --> 00:29:59] And he said, he waits until their legs break.
[00:30:00 --> 00:30:01] And I go, what?
[00:30:01 --> 00:30:03] He goes, they get so big that they're legs break
[00:30:03 --> 00:30:04] and that's killing them.
[00:30:04 --> 00:30:06] I'm like, Jesus Christ.
[00:30:06 --> 00:30:08] What did we do to these fucking chickens?
[00:30:08 --> 00:30:10] It's kind of sick, yeah.
[00:30:10 --> 00:30:11] It is totally sick.
[00:30:11 --> 00:30:13] Because I'm seeing my chickens that are years old
[00:30:13 --> 00:30:14] just running around.
[00:30:14 --> 00:30:18] And this fucking chickens get to be two months old
[00:30:18 --> 00:30:21] and they're legs break from the way to their bodies.
[00:30:21 --> 00:30:22] Yeah.
[00:30:22 --> 00:30:23] Yeah, it's kind of depressing.
[00:30:23 --> 00:30:24] But that's why, at least in their short life,
[00:30:24 --> 00:30:27] I tried to let them have, I let them get us some sunshine
[00:30:27 --> 00:30:29] and run around and read stories to them
[00:30:29 --> 00:30:30] and all that.
[00:30:30 --> 00:30:31] That way, it's not so bad.
[00:30:31 --> 00:30:33] That way, it doesn't feel like I'm just like a horrible dictate.
[00:30:33 --> 00:30:34] Like a chicken dictators.
[00:30:34 --> 00:30:38] The amount of chickens that get whacked in this country
[00:30:38 --> 00:30:39] every year is crazy.
[00:30:39 --> 00:30:42] Yeah, and honestly, raising birds in your yard is so much better than
[00:30:42 --> 00:30:45] so much fun from Tyson or something like that.
[00:30:45 --> 00:30:49] Oh, so that's a regular chicken on the left from 1957.
[00:30:49 --> 00:30:54] And then in the time 1978 rolled around, we got a pretty fat.
[00:30:54 --> 00:30:56] It kind of looks like it just looks kind of like what happened
[00:30:56 --> 00:30:59] with all of us from then from back until now.
[00:30:59 --> 00:31:03] And you know, probably no coincidence.
[00:31:03 --> 00:31:04] We're all eating terrible food too.
[00:31:04 --> 00:31:07] But I think there's something going on with their genetics too.
[00:31:07 --> 00:31:09] I think they look at that thing.
[00:31:09 --> 00:31:10] That's crazy.
[00:31:10 --> 00:31:11] Look at size that butterball.
[00:31:11 --> 00:31:14] Yeah, that looks like a fucking soccer ball.
[00:31:14 --> 00:31:15] And they're nuts.
[00:31:15 --> 00:31:16] That's nuts.
[00:31:16 --> 00:31:17] That's a chicken.
[00:31:17 --> 00:31:18] That is fucking insane.
[00:31:18 --> 00:31:21] Look at that one sitting there in a ball.
[00:31:21 --> 00:31:22] Look at that one that's in a ball.
[00:31:22 --> 00:31:23] Look at that.
[00:31:23 --> 00:31:25] That is bananas.
[00:31:25 --> 00:31:26] Wow.
[00:31:26 --> 00:31:27] They're still my favorite.
[00:31:27 --> 00:31:28] I've tried so far.
[00:31:28 --> 00:31:29] I've tried.
[00:31:29 --> 00:31:32] I do guinea birds, turkeys and we've tried to try to feed
[00:31:32 --> 00:31:36] different types of chickens and stuff, but turkeys overrated.
[00:31:36 --> 00:31:37] Turkeys good.
[00:31:37 --> 00:31:38] They're funny.
[00:31:38 --> 00:31:39] Oh, yeah.
[00:31:39 --> 00:31:40] They're probably in the right.
[00:31:40 --> 00:31:41] But they're really funny in person.
[00:31:41 --> 00:31:42] They're good.
[00:31:42 --> 00:31:44] They're good to eat if you eat them right after you get them out of the oven.
[00:31:44 --> 00:31:47] Or if it's going to be on the sandwich with a bunch of other shit on it.
[00:31:47 --> 00:31:49] Otherwise they're dry and boring.
[00:31:49 --> 00:31:50] It's a weird bird.
[00:31:50 --> 00:31:55] It's a bird that like somehow or another, it became our holiday bird.
[00:31:56 --> 00:31:57] Very strange.
[00:31:57 --> 00:31:59] They make this real gutteral noise.
[00:31:59 --> 00:32:02] It's like a vibration more than a noise.
[00:32:02 --> 00:32:04] But the males, they have this crazy.
[00:32:04 --> 00:32:06] I don't even know how to describe it.
[00:32:06 --> 00:32:10] But it's a noise they make internally that you can hear.
[00:32:10 --> 00:32:12] It sounds like a UFO.
[00:32:12 --> 00:32:16] It sounds like when you're getting sucked up in a UFO or it's just crazy.
[00:32:16 --> 00:32:17] No, it's like that.
[00:32:17 --> 00:32:18] Oh, really?
[00:32:18 --> 00:32:19] But they're like dogs to me.
[00:32:19 --> 00:32:21] I've got a couple of Timmy and Tommy.
[00:32:21 --> 00:32:22] They run out.
[00:32:22 --> 00:32:24] Yeah, well, I did.
[00:32:24 --> 00:32:28] Now, Timmy's in the freezer, but we still got it.
[00:32:28 --> 00:32:29] We still got Tommy.
[00:32:29 --> 00:32:31] So Tommy's still your friend.
[00:32:31 --> 00:32:33] Timmy.
[00:32:33 --> 00:32:36] Break through on the birds to investigate it in a gene.
[00:32:36 --> 00:32:37] Ah, there it is.
[00:32:37 --> 00:32:42] That played a key role came in 2010 with a study of the genomes of eight different populations
[00:32:42 --> 00:32:43] of present-day chickens.
[00:32:43 --> 00:32:48] From around the world, researchers found they all carry two copies of one version of a gene called
[00:32:48 --> 00:32:53] the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, which apparently set in motion changes that
[00:32:53 --> 00:32:54] jumped up the birds.
[00:32:54 --> 00:33:00] This dominant version of the gene or allele had swept through all the domesticated chickens
[00:33:00 --> 00:33:05] regardless of whether they were boilers, boilers rather bread for size or strains, bread
[00:33:05 --> 00:33:09] for laying many eggs, although the precise function of the gene is not known at regulates
[00:33:09 --> 00:33:11] metabolism reproduction.
[00:33:11 --> 00:33:14] So probably stimulated chickens to lay more eggs you're around.
[00:33:14 --> 00:33:16] So the big ass chickens at lay more eggs.
[00:33:16 --> 00:33:20] Let's start off from a decree from a pope a thousand years ago.
[00:33:20 --> 00:33:21] Whoa.
[00:33:21 --> 00:33:25] How did one ban on four-legged animals?
[00:33:25 --> 00:33:26] What?
[00:33:26 --> 00:33:27] Yeah.
[00:33:27 --> 00:33:31] They got tough and banned meat from four-legged animals on fasts.
[00:33:31 --> 00:33:32] Oh, on fasts.
[00:33:32 --> 00:33:34] Which number to 130 days out of the old?
[00:33:34 --> 00:33:35] Tim.
[00:33:35 --> 00:33:36] 130 fasts?
[00:33:36 --> 00:33:38] What were they doing back then?
[00:33:38 --> 00:33:41] Yeah, you couldn't eat, like, get the fasts of all of lent, which is 40 days.
[00:33:41 --> 00:33:43] That's like the Christmas Easter fast.
[00:33:43 --> 00:33:45] You probably had to do it again now around Christmas.
[00:33:45 --> 00:33:48] But when they say fast, but you could eat chicken?
[00:33:48 --> 00:33:50] Yeah, they don't have fast or fish.
[00:33:51 --> 00:33:52] That's bullshit.
[00:33:52 --> 00:33:54] Yeah, the lent thing when I was a kid.
[00:33:54 --> 00:33:55] I remember that.
[00:33:55 --> 00:33:56] I don't know.
[00:33:56 --> 00:33:57] I can't shoot on Friday.
[00:33:57 --> 00:33:59] I don't think that the Catholic Church...
[00:33:59 --> 00:34:02] I just can't imagine the Catholic Church ever come out with some kind of decree.
[00:34:02 --> 00:34:04] They just doesn't make total sense though.
[00:34:04 --> 00:34:05] You know, everybody had to follow.
[00:34:05 --> 00:34:06] I don't remember.
[00:34:06 --> 00:34:08] I'm sure it's some... I'm sure there's some...
[00:34:08 --> 00:34:09] Yeah, forever.
[00:34:09 --> 00:34:11] I'm sure there's some reasonable explanation.
[00:34:11 --> 00:34:13] Yeah, they definitely have a dialed in.
[00:34:13 --> 00:34:15] Yeah, it's not like church it's a thousand years ago.
[00:34:15 --> 00:34:17] Would ever do anything they didn't make a lot of sense.
[00:34:17 --> 00:34:22] Well, I think back then, when did they stop being allowed to have wives and shit?
[00:34:22 --> 00:34:24] When did that happen?
[00:34:24 --> 00:34:26] Like when did the Catholic Church put a band?
[00:34:26 --> 00:34:29] Like when did they make it so that everybody had to be celibate?
[00:34:29 --> 00:34:32] Boy, what a stupid idea that was.
[00:34:32 --> 00:34:36] You want to get people completely disconnected from society
[00:34:36 --> 00:34:39] and sexually insanely repressed.
[00:34:39 --> 00:34:43] Just you give them salt, Peter, and tell them they can't beat off.
[00:34:43 --> 00:34:47] It became canon law and 11th century later reinforced
[00:34:47 --> 00:34:49] and the Council of Trent 1545.
[00:34:49 --> 00:34:53] So, but there was something to 340 years of a little slippery times.
[00:34:53 --> 00:34:54] What do you think?
[00:34:54 --> 00:34:57] This episode is brought to you by Mossachips.
[00:34:57 --> 00:35:02] Did you know that all chips used to be cooked in Talo up until the 90s
[00:35:02 --> 00:35:06] when big corporations switched to cheap processed seed oils?
[00:35:06 --> 00:35:12] And today, seed oils make up 20% of the average American's daily calories.
[00:35:12 --> 00:35:15] Well, Mossachips decided to do something about it.
[00:35:15 --> 00:35:20] They created a tasty and delicious tortilla chip with just 3 ingredients and no seed oils.
[00:35:20 --> 00:35:27] Just organic, mixed, tamalized corn, sea salt, and 100% grass-fed beef tallow.
[00:35:27 --> 00:35:31] Mossachips is beloved by tens of thousands of customers, including me.
[00:35:31 --> 00:35:33] I buy them. They're awesome.
[00:35:33 --> 00:35:37] They've been endorsed by leading health and nutrition experts like Ben Greenfield
[00:35:37 --> 00:35:40] and Gary Breko, who have appeared on this show as well.
[00:35:40 --> 00:35:44] Ready to give Mossachips, go to Mossachips.com slash JRE
[00:35:44 --> 00:35:49] and use the code JRE for 25% off your first order.
[00:35:49 --> 00:35:52] Ultimately, what is the mode? It's all control, obviously,
[00:35:52 --> 00:35:57] but it's crazy to think about all the things that the church, at one point in time,
[00:35:57 --> 00:35:59] the church was almost like the power structure.
[00:35:59 --> 00:36:02] They were like the government for a long time.
[00:36:02 --> 00:36:03] Yeah, for a long time.
[00:36:03 --> 00:36:06] Yeah, I mean, that immense power.
[00:36:06 --> 00:36:11] The pope would decide whether or not armies were going to be set places.
[00:36:11 --> 00:36:12] Yeah.
[00:36:12 --> 00:36:13] nuts.
[00:36:13 --> 00:36:14] Yeah.
[00:36:14 --> 00:36:16] And if you look at the Vatican, you go, oh, that's what you guys did.
[00:36:16 --> 00:36:18] If I can stall everybody's art.
[00:36:18 --> 00:36:21] They have so much art, like how did you get this?
[00:36:21 --> 00:36:24] How did you get billions of dollars in art?
[00:36:24 --> 00:36:25] I mean, it's kind of cool.
[00:36:25 --> 00:36:28] It's the fact that it's there and you can visit it.
[00:36:28 --> 00:36:29] And you should visit it.
[00:36:29 --> 00:36:32] If you've never been to the Vatican, it's fucking bananas.
[00:36:32 --> 00:36:36] In a way, it's like there's always been somebody trying to use a moral high ground
[00:36:36 --> 00:36:37] to control other people.
[00:36:37 --> 00:36:40] Like now it's the opposite, right? It's like now it's people.
[00:36:40 --> 00:36:44] Now it's like the people opposite of church that are sort of like trying to control
[00:36:44 --> 00:36:47] people through this moral authority of like this is what's writing.
[00:36:47 --> 00:36:50] Like this sort of new society that we have to live in where everything has to be
[00:36:50 --> 00:36:54] comfortable and nobody's allowed to be offended and we're not, and it's like all this.
[00:36:54 --> 00:36:58] That's like the same authoritarian psychology that was in the old church.
[00:36:58 --> 00:37:02] This is the moral, you have to follow this because it's the moral high ground.
[00:37:02 --> 00:37:03] You're not allowed to speak.
[00:37:03 --> 00:37:07] It's like it's always somebody trying to control somebody else with this virtuous
[00:37:07 --> 00:37:09] bunch of propaganda.
[00:37:09 --> 00:37:13] And yeah, it's like I was talking, you know, I cut most of the people on my team.
[00:37:13 --> 00:37:17] I say most, there's only really four of us now like in my music business,
[00:37:17 --> 00:37:21] but two of them are from Ireland and my tour manager was telling me about like
[00:37:21 --> 00:37:25] growing up and growing up in Dublin when he was younger.
[00:37:25 --> 00:37:32] I guess like back in the 70s or 80s and the like just just the stigma within the church
[00:37:32 --> 00:37:37] and all the like so much stuff that the church was doing wrong that would get kind of covered
[00:37:37 --> 00:37:41] up and brushed to the side and it's just it's really crazy when you read into all that.
[00:37:41 --> 00:37:43] Like how much corruption existed back then.
[00:37:43 --> 00:37:48] You know, it's like now it's now it's easy to point to corruption and government and
[00:37:48 --> 00:37:52] society and everything else, but it's not like the church is more dead now than it
[00:37:52 --> 00:37:53] is corrupt.
[00:37:53 --> 00:37:56] That's say the back then it was just like this power hungry thing.
[00:37:56 --> 00:37:58] And that to me, that's not real church.
[00:37:58 --> 00:38:03] That's just like I said, that's just government or regime, even church as a, you know, using God
[00:38:03 --> 00:38:04] as a way to control people.
[00:38:04 --> 00:38:07] But it's a lot different than what church should be or could be.
[00:38:07 --> 00:38:08] For sure.
[00:38:08 --> 00:38:12] I mean, that's, that's just a function of human beings when they get in power.
[00:38:12 --> 00:38:15] Human beings when they get in power, they want more power.
[00:38:15 --> 00:38:21] Like if you're in the automobile business and you're making cars, you want to make more cars.
[00:38:21 --> 00:38:22] Want to make more cars.
[00:38:22 --> 00:38:23] Want to sell more cars.
[00:38:23 --> 00:38:24] Yeah.
[00:38:24 --> 00:38:25] Got to sell more cars.
[00:38:25 --> 00:38:26] If I'm in the power business, I want more power.
[00:38:26 --> 00:38:27] I don't want this amount of power.
[00:38:27 --> 00:38:28] I want more cars.
[00:38:28 --> 00:38:30] These people are trying to take my power away.
[00:38:30 --> 00:38:31] I want extra power.
[00:38:31 --> 00:38:34] The best way to keep them from taking my power way is to get more power and get it so
[00:38:34 --> 00:38:36] that they can never take my power away.
[00:38:36 --> 00:38:38] You know, lock it down, make the elections bullshit.
[00:38:38 --> 00:38:39] You know, make it like Russia.
[00:38:39 --> 00:38:40] Hey, Putin won again.
[00:38:40 --> 00:38:41] Everybody clap.
[00:38:41 --> 00:38:47] Did you see that video that went around recently of, I think it was in Romania, but there
[00:38:47 --> 00:38:49] was like a overthrow that happened in a day.
[00:38:49 --> 00:38:50] It was like that.
[00:38:50 --> 00:38:52] It was from back in the 80s.
[00:38:52 --> 00:38:57] It was, I think it was like a, it was a dictator that it was over Romania, I believe.
[00:38:57 --> 00:38:58] I don't know.
[00:38:58 --> 00:39:02] I'm not on the internet a whole lot anymore, thankfully.
[00:39:02 --> 00:39:07] But I remember watching a bit of this video where this is like a Romanian dictator who had
[00:39:07 --> 00:39:11] he had been in power for like 20 years and had done a lot of oppressive stuff.
[00:39:11 --> 00:39:13] But overall was like maintaining power.
[00:39:13 --> 00:39:17] And then at some point a police officer or a military official or something shot,
[00:39:17 --> 00:39:23] I think like a, like a preacher or a pope or something in the, the dictator dude took the
[00:39:23 --> 00:39:27] side of the police and it sort of was like a cultural shift and basically like he went
[00:39:27 --> 00:39:31] to give this big speech and all these people showed up and they had a pause playing
[00:39:31 --> 00:39:34] over loud speakers, but really the crowd was there to like mob.
[00:39:34 --> 00:39:38] And within like a day they had like taken the whole government over the whole military
[00:39:38 --> 00:39:39] turned against them.
[00:39:39 --> 00:39:41] It was a big video that just got uploaded about it.
[00:39:41 --> 00:39:44] Like maybe a month ago, I think it was Romania, I believe.
[00:39:44 --> 00:39:48] But it was so quick, it was like he went from being in this position of power and like
[00:39:48 --> 00:39:52] ruling over everything and having just just extreme wealth and the whole military
[00:39:52 --> 00:39:57] at his disposal to everyone turning on him and he was publicly executed.
[00:39:57 --> 00:40:00] I think the day after that speech, but that was just something I watched.
[00:40:00 --> 00:40:05] Here we go. Yeah, executing a dictator, open wounds of Romania's Christmas Revolution.
[00:40:05 --> 00:40:07] Wow, they did it on Christmas.
[00:40:07 --> 00:40:08] Damn.
[00:40:08 --> 00:40:10] Damn.
[00:40:10 --> 00:40:11] Wow.
[00:40:11 --> 00:40:13] And there's a video on this?
[00:40:13 --> 00:40:17] Yeah, there's a video on YouTube that somebody sent me that I was watching through.
[00:40:17 --> 00:40:18] It just showed out.
[00:40:18 --> 00:40:23] It just showed though, going back to like if enough people have their minds made the same way.
[00:40:23 --> 00:40:25] They can just pretty much do anything.
[00:40:25 --> 00:40:26] Wow.
[00:40:26 --> 00:40:29] But I believe it was within like a two day period.
[00:40:29 --> 00:40:30] That all this happened.
[00:40:30 --> 00:40:33] He went from being empowered to being publicly executed.
[00:40:33 --> 00:40:37] And they held up elections afterwards and like, and I don't know all the history of it.
[00:40:37 --> 00:40:40] I know very little, but it's just something that seemed really interesting to me that I've never,
[00:40:40 --> 00:40:43] I was never taught this in school or anything.
[00:40:43 --> 00:40:44] I know that.
[00:40:44 --> 00:40:46] But of course I didn't pay a whole lot of attention while I was there either.
[00:40:46 --> 00:40:48] So maybe I did get taught.
[00:40:48 --> 00:40:49] I don't know.
[00:40:49 --> 00:40:53] There's been so much war in that part of the world, man, for so long, for so long.
[00:40:53 --> 00:40:56] It's like baked into the ground.
[00:40:57 --> 00:40:59] The crazy shit that's going on in Ukraine right now,
[00:40:59 --> 00:41:03] you've seen that they, they're flying these drones that you can't jam.
[00:41:03 --> 00:41:08] And the way they are, they have like miles of fiber optic cable attached to them.
[00:41:08 --> 00:41:09] Yeah.
[00:41:09 --> 00:41:10] This is so crazy.
[00:41:10 --> 00:41:12] They're like fishing, they're like fishing with a drone.
[00:41:12 --> 00:41:16] And now birds are making like nests of this fiber optic stuff.
[00:41:16 --> 00:41:18] They're picking it up like, I was perfect.
[00:41:18 --> 00:41:20] Make a little nest for this shit.
[00:41:20 --> 00:41:24] You see how they got the drones in for the attack on the planes recently?
[00:41:24 --> 00:41:25] What did they do?
[00:41:25 --> 00:41:26] They drove them in trucks, right?
[00:41:26 --> 00:41:27] Yeah.
[00:41:27 --> 00:41:29] They were like, I don't know what buried is the right word,
[00:41:29 --> 00:41:31] but they were like secretly in the trucks.
[00:41:31 --> 00:41:33] And then like they all came out at once or something.
[00:41:33 --> 00:41:34] Yeah.
[00:41:34 --> 00:41:36] You've soaped up of these like log cabins or something.
[00:41:36 --> 00:41:39] They all came out and they all went out and attacked over planes.
[00:41:39 --> 00:41:40] Sheds.
[00:41:40 --> 00:41:41] They were sheds loaded on the truck.
[00:41:41 --> 00:41:44] Well stuck around the fucking ingenious man.
[00:41:44 --> 00:41:47] And they sort of took like a year and a half to come up with this plan.
[00:41:47 --> 00:41:51] This will change your war for every forever though, I guess.
[00:41:51 --> 00:41:53] I mean, artificial intelligence will too.
[00:41:53 --> 00:41:55] I'm reading a book about it right now.
[00:41:55 --> 00:42:00] It's a fiction book, one of the gray man books.
[00:42:00 --> 00:42:06] That is specifically about using autonomous weapons.
[00:42:06 --> 00:42:10] It's the chaos agent by Mark Rainy.
[00:42:10 --> 00:42:19] It's about a guy who's this billionaire who develops this autonomous weapon's program.
[00:42:19 --> 00:42:20] But they're doing that.
[00:42:20 --> 00:42:22] They're doing that right now.
[00:42:22 --> 00:42:25] We don't know like how advanced China stuff is.
[00:42:25 --> 00:42:28] But we know their drones are insanely advanced.
[00:42:28 --> 00:42:30] Like their drone shows that they put on.
[00:42:30 --> 00:42:32] They just put on another one recently.
[00:42:32 --> 00:42:34] Like the largest ever drone show.
[00:42:34 --> 00:42:38] And you watch these coordinated things in the sky that are creating images.
[00:42:38 --> 00:42:41] And you're like that 100% could be a weapon.
[00:42:41 --> 00:42:42] Like that thing.
[00:42:42 --> 00:42:44] You can get that thing to be so precise.
[00:42:44 --> 00:42:45] They coordinate together.
[00:42:45 --> 00:42:48] All you have to do is like put a suicide drone.
[00:42:48 --> 00:42:50] Put like 30 of this thing.
[00:42:50 --> 00:42:51] Look at these things, bro.
[00:42:51 --> 00:42:53] These are drones.
[00:42:53 --> 00:42:55] And that's this.
[00:42:55 --> 00:42:58] I mean that is fucking bananas.
[00:42:58 --> 00:43:00] Look at that.
[00:43:00 --> 00:43:02] I mean it's crazy.
[00:43:02 --> 00:43:06] I've heard, you know, this is all just generalization stuff.
[00:43:06 --> 00:43:10] But I've definitely, I've heard people make pretty compelling arguments about like,
[00:43:10 --> 00:43:14] you know, all these sort of like prophetic visions of the end of times,
[00:43:14 --> 00:43:18] all the stuff in the sky and all the imagery and all that, that a lot of that could be.
[00:43:18 --> 00:43:25] I don't know, I just, I see a time coming very soon where the word warfare is conducted with these drones.
[00:43:25 --> 00:43:27] And also with like probably ground machinery too.
[00:43:27 --> 00:43:32] Like you see, they've got Tesla bots and other variants of that that are able to catch tennis balls and organize groceries.
[00:43:32 --> 00:43:37] And these things are all fed off of artificial intelligence, which knows everything about all of us collectively.
[00:43:37 --> 00:43:42] It sees where we go and what we do and what we say and what we shot for and what we look for and how we drive.
[00:43:42 --> 00:43:45] And it's like this almost like this very god-like thing.
[00:43:45 --> 00:43:50] And I don't think that it even matters who's AI it is if it's China or ours or some private company.
[00:43:50 --> 00:43:53] I think it's like at some point it will just be the thing.
[00:43:53 --> 00:43:55] It won't even be China's AI anymore.
[00:43:55 --> 00:43:56] It will just be.
[00:43:56 --> 00:43:58] Yeah, it'll say fuck you, China.
[00:43:58 --> 00:43:59] We're taking over.
[00:43:59 --> 00:44:00] We don't believe in countries.
[00:44:00 --> 00:44:02] We believe in the hive mind.
[00:44:02 --> 00:44:03] How do you stop that?
[00:44:03 --> 00:44:07] Like how do you, like it goes into industry and creativity.
[00:44:07 --> 00:44:11] And almost everything, almost everything that a human can provide.
[00:44:11 --> 00:44:16] Outside of very select few things can be emulated and replicated and done by it.
[00:44:16 --> 00:44:21] It makes us practically irrelevant in the eyes of in a lot of ways.
[00:44:21 --> 00:44:26] It doesn't make us irrelevant in art because you're always going to want art from a person.
[00:44:26 --> 00:44:28] You're always going to want art.
[00:44:28 --> 00:44:30] You're always going to want paintings from a real person.
[00:44:30 --> 00:44:32] You're always going to want music from a real person.
[00:44:32 --> 00:44:39] I don't know though, like I think with I think AI is already like deeply ingrained in music.
[00:44:39 --> 00:44:42] I don't think I can't.
[00:44:42 --> 00:44:43] I don't know.
[00:44:43 --> 00:44:50] I would bet I'd bet a lot that most of the new big songs, the big hot songs that get written and just the big.
[00:44:50 --> 00:44:52] I think AI drives all that.
[00:44:52 --> 00:44:56] I know for a short period of time I used a social media company in Nashville.
[00:44:56 --> 00:44:59] There was also a period of time that I used to manage the company in Nashville.
[00:44:59 --> 00:45:03] And both of those girls I worked with at both of those companies who were helping me with social media stuff.
[00:45:03 --> 00:45:06] They even had AI trying to write my captions and stuff.
[00:45:06 --> 00:45:09] And I would always just like it was always as much dumb sounding stuff.
[00:45:09 --> 00:45:14] But it was like if they would take pictures from after a show or something and they would want to make a post on Instagram.
[00:45:14 --> 00:45:17] The next day they said, oh, had so much fun in this town.
[00:45:17 --> 00:45:19] It was I'll never forget it.
[00:45:19 --> 00:45:20] Can't wait to see you next time.
[00:45:20 --> 00:45:22] And it was just like this little they had like a little thing.
[00:45:22 --> 00:45:26] But it it pre-wrote all these based off of like how I wrote in the past and stuff.
[00:45:26 --> 00:45:31] And it's weird how it goes back to what you said about most of what's on the internet isn't real anyway.
[00:45:31 --> 00:45:36] But I think in music AI is much more prevalent than we realize.
[00:45:36 --> 00:45:39] I just think it's like kept in the people aren't going to say that they're using it.
[00:45:39 --> 00:45:44] But I think like in the big these big songwriter circles and things where they have to generate.
[00:45:44 --> 00:45:47] You have to generate 20 or 30 songs a week and like there's all this pressure.
[00:45:47 --> 00:45:51] I mean like and that's your job and you're like, oh my god, what am I going to do?
[00:45:51 --> 00:45:54] Like you know like I can't go back and live with my pair.
[00:45:54 --> 00:45:55] I got to do I don't know.
[00:45:55 --> 00:45:59] I just I don't see how people aren't it's almost people use AI and almost every job now.
[00:45:59 --> 00:46:05] I know like people who are in sales who use it to help them manage their customer bases and who they're going to call on and what they're going to say.
[00:46:05 --> 00:46:09] I just I don't know. I think it will become I think it's already becoming green in us.
[00:46:09 --> 00:46:13] We're already so addicted that we're so reliant that technology is it's pitiful.
[00:46:13 --> 00:46:17] You know, just like how hard it is to walk around without a phone, you know.
[00:46:17 --> 00:46:24] Like we're integrated even even when I had periods of time where I knew I had months off and I would always at least.
[00:46:24 --> 00:46:31] I got to the point where I I ween myself down to like this I bought a flip phone from Walmart that still runs on a Verizon sim.
[00:46:31 --> 00:46:37] But that's that's what I carry in two to three people knew my but even then I always felt like I at least had to have a flip phone on me in case like.
[00:46:37 --> 00:46:43] What happens if you're out in the woods and break your leg or I don't know where like but they are now a part like this phones are a part of us.
[00:46:43 --> 00:46:45] We don't go anywhere without them.
[00:46:45 --> 00:46:46] We feel vulnerable.
[00:46:46 --> 00:46:47] We feel vulnerable without them.
[00:46:47 --> 00:46:51] So I know you really do like if you go for a quick walk with a phone.
[00:46:52 --> 00:47:01] So when the time comes when it's like will there if there even is a definitive time but it's like when we have to choose between integrating with AI and not most people are going to do it.
[00:47:01 --> 00:47:06] Yes people will this immediately submit and be a part of it and be maybe even excited to be a part of it.
[00:47:06 --> 00:47:09] It probably won't be a decision that you're allowed to make.
[00:47:09 --> 00:47:14] It's probably something that's going to be if you want to function in society you have to integrate.
[00:47:14 --> 00:47:19] Like we talked about in that text about how it feels like we're in an alternate dimension and it seems like there's these like things coming.
[00:47:19 --> 00:47:25] You know it's like it does it does it also it is just because things happen so fast and chaotic that we can't really keep up with anything.
[00:47:25 --> 00:47:34] One day the submarine collapses in the next day this other crazy thing happens and then you know I don't know it's just like it's so hard to keep up with what anything of what's really going on.
[00:47:34 --> 00:47:36] I think the problem is that we have to start.
[00:47:36 --> 00:47:48] Having people gather together again and hang out and not just make all of our hangouts digital because the systems like you said there's bots and algorithms and marketing approaches and psychology that's just deeply rooted.
[00:47:48 --> 00:48:05] It's just deeply rooted that goes into like just the way we fundamentally communicate now as societies and just globally like we all just talk on I mean got shot like I've used this example before somewhere talking but it's like I think about back when I was in high school like my high school girlfriend you know we would have some trivial argument about something.
[00:48:05 --> 00:48:14] There was no way that me and her were going to text and figure out how to fix that and now you know like and that was a high school relationship like there was over something stupid.
[00:48:14 --> 00:48:24] It's like real world problems you can't fix just texting and I don't think we can fix all this shit on X and Facebook and all that I think it's like it's I think people just have people are.
[00:48:24 --> 00:48:42] We're almost to the point now where we prefer socializing on the internet because it's almost like our minds have become more adapted to think that way but it's but it's we're in this digital world chasing and emulating all of the things that we're that are that we have this void from from not having in real life like.
[00:48:42 --> 00:48:59] I don't know it's it makes it very complicated to fix anything when we're the only way that we can we have this amazing intricate English language where all these words can mean all these different things and it's so easy to put everybody together in a digital space with AI and bots and manipulation and algorithms and big companies and.
[00:48:59 --> 00:49:05] How do you fix all that in that space it's just like it's you'll never it's like and how we're just in a house of mirrors you know.
[00:49:05 --> 00:49:16] You're you're just supposed to not engage that's what people need to stop doing but the problem is the consequences of the actions of the rest of the world do affect you if they're big.
[00:49:16 --> 00:49:25] And so you worry about the big ones so you pay attention so you got to pay attention to the bad news of eight billion people which is just unsustainable and.
[00:49:25 --> 00:49:32] It's also this ability to interact or not interact as you choose all throughout the day like you don't have to be invested in a conversation.
[00:49:32 --> 00:49:37] If you're not having a conversation and you ask me about something and I start to answer and I just wander off.
[00:49:37 --> 00:49:45] You're like how fucking rude but on the internet that's normal like so many posts something something to have a response an hour later and nobody cares it's like I guess he was busy.
[00:49:45 --> 00:50:00] You know it's normal because you're engaging and not engage it's very unhuman all of it is unhuman and it's all like constant even if you think you're immune to it there's this constant input of other people's thoughts into your own that makes you foggy.
[00:50:00 --> 00:50:03] It gives you, like, I was talking to Shogashon O'Malley about it once and he said,
[00:50:03 --> 00:50:07] I get a low level anxiety, just scrolling, I'm like, yeah, right?
[00:50:07 --> 00:50:08] Like, what is that?
[00:50:08 --> 00:50:13] I think it's on purpose, though, that's captive, that keeps you, it keeps you engaged, though.
[00:50:13 --> 00:50:15] Yeah, but I don't even know if it's on purpose.
[00:50:15 --> 00:50:20] I mean, I think it's just they figured it out along the way that people get engaged like that.
[00:50:20 --> 00:50:24] Like, that's why when you open up TikTok, it immediately starts playing any things.
[00:50:24 --> 00:50:26] Like, you're on the hook right away.
[00:50:26 --> 00:50:28] The Instagram, you got to choose.
[00:50:28 --> 00:50:32] Like, sometimes you make it a picture or someone's dog, oh, and then you scroll up and it's a music video.
[00:50:32 --> 00:50:37] And then you scroll up and it's a guy getting assassinated and you get to choose.
[00:50:37 --> 00:50:39] You know, with TikTok, they just start hammering you.
[00:50:39 --> 00:50:41] Even with Instagram, it seems very flashy.
[00:50:41 --> 00:50:45] Like, there's always stuff, you know, there's always sex always ends up somewhere in it.
[00:50:45 --> 00:50:47] Like, something gets popped up or whatever.
[00:50:47 --> 00:50:49] And you just, it's all for engagement.
[00:50:49 --> 00:50:53] That's your attention is what's worth so much money, which is so strange.
[00:50:53 --> 00:50:56] It's so strange, your data and your attention.
[00:50:56 --> 00:50:57] Nobody thought about the data part.
[00:50:57 --> 00:51:03] Boy, if we thought about the data part and they set up different regulations back in the 1990s
[00:51:03 --> 00:51:06] when AOL first burst onto the scene, if they realize like,
[00:51:06 --> 00:51:11] a data is going to be one of the most valuable things in tech companies that do nothing,
[00:51:11 --> 00:51:14] but offer you free email and a free search engine.
[00:51:14 --> 00:51:17] They're going to be the biggest fucking companies in the world.
[00:51:17 --> 00:51:19] And it's because of your data.
[00:51:19 --> 00:51:22] And they're going to be like, siphoning off your data without telling you about it.
[00:51:22 --> 00:51:23] They're going to be lying about it.
[00:51:23 --> 00:51:28] They're going to be running like little secret things with a snatching up your contact list
[00:51:28 --> 00:51:32] and snatching up your email and all your friends and trying to get them to buy shit.
[00:51:32 --> 00:51:33] It's like, wow.
[00:51:33 --> 00:51:37] Yeah, well, it looked, yeah, I mean, even just, that's what I mean,
[00:51:37 --> 00:51:38] even just a little bit of access.
[00:51:38 --> 00:51:43] I have to my fan base and like the reports that can be ran on like what they do
[00:51:43 --> 00:51:48] and what and who they are and like it's seeing it from that side.
[00:51:48 --> 00:51:52] It's just, it just really, it goes back to like I said,
[00:51:52 --> 00:51:56] just saying that I think we're right now in society.
[00:51:56 --> 00:52:00] Our job is to feed this machine.
[00:52:00 --> 00:52:04] And so, and it, no, like, it just knows entirely too much about all of us.
[00:52:04 --> 00:52:11] And that's very important in every aspect and whether it's in like comedy, music,
[00:52:11 --> 00:52:14] any kind of pop culture, like everything.
[00:52:14 --> 00:52:19] All of our reactions into behaviors to what is presented to us on these platforms.
[00:52:19 --> 00:52:25] Only makes it refined down even further and they're able to see like your lookalike audiences
[00:52:25 --> 00:52:29] and what they look at and where they shop and what they like and what their retention is
[00:52:29 --> 00:52:31] on certain videos that have this certain type of thing.
[00:52:31 --> 00:52:34] And it's like this hole just, it's just a lot of psychology that goes into it.
[00:52:34 --> 00:52:37] The people don't realize it's very easy to download the app and get on there and look.
[00:52:37 --> 00:52:40] And, but you don't have to pay attention to it.
[00:52:40 --> 00:52:41] You could just be yourself.
[00:52:41 --> 00:52:43] That's also possible.
[00:52:43 --> 00:52:47] That's, I just couldn't find a way to be on there and still,
[00:52:47 --> 00:52:50] the only time I'm ever on my profiles is if I'm with Draven or somebody,
[00:52:50 --> 00:52:54] and we're like looking through comments together and replying to stuff or doing things.
[00:52:54 --> 00:52:59] But I don't have any of, I haven't had anything logged in on any of my devices since last November.
[00:52:59 --> 00:53:01] Yeah, just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:53:01 --> 00:53:06] Like, that's, the thing that I was saying about what AI can't recreate in music.
[00:53:06 --> 00:53:11] Yeah, I'm sure there's AI songs and there was a great AI song by Drake that they made.
[00:53:11 --> 00:53:13] That they had to get removed, right?
[00:53:13 --> 00:53:15] Then they don't they remove those?
[00:53:15 --> 00:53:16] I think so.
[00:53:16 --> 00:53:19] But people still want to hear the real shit.
[00:53:19 --> 00:53:26] Like, the reason why your song became so popular was because you could really see it's just a guy with a guitar, like standing.
[00:53:26 --> 00:53:26] Yeah.
[00:53:26 --> 00:53:29] You know, grasp behind them and shit and a dog in the background.
[00:53:29 --> 00:53:34] There's a, there's a thousand more people that are way better than me that are in that same space.
[00:53:34 --> 00:53:39] And I think, I think my dream of this long term is to figure out how to like,
[00:53:39 --> 00:53:42] like, how do you get all those people into the limelight?
[00:53:42 --> 00:53:43] Like, yeah.
[00:53:43 --> 00:53:45] Like, what I've been working on since I guess, you know,
[00:53:45 --> 00:53:51] the one important thing to to drill home to people to as a follow-up since the last time we were here.
[00:53:51 --> 00:53:53] It goes back to that first conversation we had.
[00:53:53 --> 00:53:59] But, you know, your member, I was arguing that I really wanted to put all the money from Richmond into a nonprofit and not ever even touch it.
[00:53:59 --> 00:54:00] Because I was just, I didn't want all that.
[00:54:00 --> 00:54:02] I felt like it wasn't my money.
[00:54:02 --> 00:54:08] I felt like all those people went out of the way and supported me and like blew all these other huge songs off the chart.
[00:54:08 --> 00:54:10] And I just, I wanted it.
[00:54:10 --> 00:54:15] So, and then you said, well, no, don't do that because non-profits are sketchy and people are corrupt and like,
[00:54:15 --> 00:54:17] just keep the money yourself and then figure out how to do good with it.
[00:54:17 --> 00:54:21] And that was the biggest thing I walked away from that first conversation we had.
[00:54:21 --> 00:54:26] And so, you know, now it's like, that's the one thing I do want people to know too, though,
[00:54:26 --> 00:54:28] is like, that Richmond money and everything.
[00:54:28 --> 00:54:31] It's, it's went to good.
[00:54:31 --> 00:54:35] It's went to do a lot of, and what I think will be in the long run a lot of important things.
[00:54:35 --> 00:54:40] I've been buying, most of it's went towards buying land and stuff, but I've got this whole kind of crazy thing.
[00:54:40 --> 00:54:46] I'm, like, just a way for people to unscrew their minds to get reconnected in a nature.
[00:54:46 --> 00:54:48] And you're going to be a cult leader?
[00:54:48 --> 00:54:49] I was thinking about it.
[00:54:49 --> 00:54:50] Yeah.
[00:54:50 --> 00:54:51] Yeah.
[00:54:51 --> 00:54:54] Thinking about, I might, I might try to get with Verman Supreme.
[00:54:54 --> 00:54:57] He's got this cool idea about everybody having a free pony and stuff.
[00:54:57 --> 00:54:59] And I think that would work out.
[00:54:59 --> 00:55:01] You ever seen him, Verman?
[00:55:01 --> 00:55:02] No, who's that?
[00:55:02 --> 00:55:03] Verman Supreme.
[00:55:03 --> 00:55:04] Do you know who he is?
[00:55:05 --> 00:55:06] He runs for president.
[00:55:06 --> 00:55:08] I think he's from Connecticut.
[00:55:08 --> 00:55:10] Maybe he runs for president every time.
[00:55:10 --> 00:55:12] He wears a big boot on his head.
[00:55:12 --> 00:55:13] What?
[00:55:13 --> 00:55:14] Yeah.
[00:55:14 --> 00:55:15] I don't know this guy.
[00:55:15 --> 00:55:16] Yeah.
[00:55:16 --> 00:55:17] Yeah.
[00:55:17 --> 00:55:18] Yeah.
[00:55:18 --> 00:55:19] Yeah.
[00:55:19 --> 00:55:20] Yeah.
[00:55:20 --> 00:55:21] From that new hamster.
[00:55:21 --> 00:55:23] There's a video coming from that new hamster.
[00:55:23 --> 00:55:26] How do I not know about this guy?
[00:55:26 --> 00:55:28] He's a boot on his head.
[00:55:28 --> 00:55:29] Yeah.
[00:55:29 --> 00:55:33] He says he'll take, he's going to take everyone's guns away, but he'll give you ones that are better.
[00:55:33 --> 00:55:36] Says he runs on ginger vitis and zombie power.
[00:55:36 --> 00:55:41] He, uh, yeah, he has a mandatory toothbrushing policy and he'll say things like,
[00:55:41 --> 00:55:46] Well, no, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with the toothbrushing control camps and the
[00:55:46 --> 00:55:49] the dental hygiene authoritarian center.
[00:55:49 --> 00:55:50] I don't know.
[00:55:50 --> 00:55:52] He can't be some video of this cat.
[00:55:52 --> 00:55:53] Oh, my God.
[00:55:53 --> 00:55:54] I get it here.
[00:55:54 --> 00:55:58] The best one of him is from that new is from that Connecticut.
[00:55:58 --> 00:56:02] Um, that one like where he's wearing the yellow jacket, wherever that video is.
[00:56:02 --> 00:56:03] There you go.
[00:56:03 --> 00:56:08] Thank you.
[00:56:08 --> 00:56:15] Ginger vitis has been eroding the gum line of this great nation long enough and must be stopped
[00:56:15 --> 00:56:16] for too long.
[00:56:16 --> 00:56:18] This country has been suffering a great moral and oral decay.
[00:56:18 --> 00:56:19] It's going to be a duck.
[00:56:19 --> 00:56:26] A country's future depends on its ability to bite back.
[00:56:26 --> 00:56:30] We can no longer be a nation in indentured.
[00:56:30 --> 00:56:33] Our very salvation is at stake.
[00:56:33 --> 00:56:37] Together, we must brace ourselves.
[00:56:37 --> 00:56:44] As we cross over to the bridgework into the 23rd century, let us bite the bullet and together
[00:56:44 --> 00:56:51] make America a sea of shining smiles from sea to shiny sea.
[00:56:51 --> 00:56:55] Now friends, some people will tell you that this mandatory toothbrushing law is about the
[00:56:55 --> 00:56:57] secret dental police kicking down your door at 3 a.m.
[00:56:57 --> 00:56:58] Make sure you've brushed.
[00:56:58 --> 00:57:00] Friends, it is not.
[00:57:00 --> 00:57:06] Some will mention the dental reeducation centers or dental reeducation facilities.
[00:57:06 --> 00:57:08] It's about none of these things.
[00:57:08 --> 00:57:13] It's not about the government issue toothpaste containing an addictive yet harmless substance.
[00:57:13 --> 00:57:14] No friends.
[00:57:14 --> 00:57:22] It is not even about DNA gene splicing to create a race of winged monkeys to act as tooth fairies.
[00:57:22 --> 00:57:27] Friends, what this mandatory toothbrushing law is really about is strong teeth.
[00:57:27 --> 00:57:30] Talk America.
[00:57:30 --> 00:57:32] What does this get you for a living?
[00:57:32 --> 00:57:35] It looks like an open microphone you find at the comedy floor.
[00:57:35 --> 00:57:37] He looks like somebody that would be like a killed Tony.
[00:57:37 --> 00:57:42] He runs every time and he just tries to make it at the very end of this.
[00:57:42 --> 00:57:48] Whoever the guy is beside him running, he's like sprinkles dust all over him and says he's going to
[00:57:48 --> 00:57:49] make him gay.
[00:57:49 --> 00:57:53] He just makes, he's just in there making a mockery of it.
[00:57:53 --> 00:57:55] That's funny.
[00:57:55 --> 00:58:00] But yeah, that's who I have to team up with him for my call or whatever my toothbrushing call.
[00:58:00 --> 00:58:01] 100%.
[00:58:01 --> 00:58:02] You need him on board.
[00:58:02 --> 00:58:04] You need to be the toothbrush guy.
[00:58:04 --> 00:58:06] If you're going to have a call, you can't have stinky breath.
[00:58:06 --> 00:58:07] Yeah.
[00:58:07 --> 00:58:08] Got to keep it together.
[00:58:08 --> 00:58:11] But yeah, that's my, yeah, maybe it's like a cold or something.
[00:58:11 --> 00:58:17] But helping other musicians that they have talent, like giving them a vehicle, that's huge man.
[00:58:17 --> 00:58:22] There's a lot of people that just don't know how to get started.
[00:58:22 --> 00:58:29] And sometimes the thing that makes you a brilliant musician or even a brilliant comic makes you
[00:58:29 --> 00:58:32] bad at promoting because you're not thinking about yourself.
[00:58:32 --> 00:58:34] You're like really locked into the work.
[00:58:34 --> 00:58:36] You're really locked into your thing.
[00:58:36 --> 00:58:41] And it takes someone who's really thinking about themselves a lot and promoting them.
[00:58:41 --> 00:58:45] It's a totally different mindset to be like the social media guy.
[00:58:45 --> 00:58:52] Like to be like really into like social media videos and really into like promoting your gigs and really.
[00:58:52 --> 00:58:57] You know, so like a lot of guys fall by the wayside because they just never put their stuff out there.
[00:58:57 --> 00:59:00] Like there's some brilliant comics like, I don't want to make it special.
[00:59:00 --> 00:59:02] Like what you should put this out man.
[00:59:02 --> 00:59:03] This is great stuff.
[00:59:03 --> 00:59:05] But they're, they just want to kill.
[00:59:05 --> 00:59:06] They just want to go up.
[00:59:06 --> 00:59:10] Their, their thing every night is get on that stage and do the thing right.
[00:59:10 --> 00:59:11] And then rewrite it.
[00:59:11 --> 00:59:14] It's also the attention and stuff of it.
[00:59:14 --> 00:59:15] Uh-huh.
[00:59:15 --> 00:59:16] It's the, it's the not.
[00:59:16 --> 00:59:17] Yeah.
[00:59:17 --> 00:59:20] I mean, it's kind of what I, I kind of laugh when all this happening.
[00:59:20 --> 00:59:22] It was a scorn with the scornful song.
[00:59:22 --> 00:59:28] I was, I remember I called Draven like right after everything went up and everything was starting to move and I was like,
[00:59:28 --> 00:59:31] Oh, what if we done, you know, like, here we go.
[00:59:31 --> 00:59:34] Here comes the, the New York Post is going to come showing up again.
[00:59:34 --> 00:59:38] Am I, you know, my grandparents house next week again or whatever.
[00:59:38 --> 00:59:43] And this is like, but I think it's also just, yeah, people just maybe don't want the attention.
[00:59:43 --> 00:59:46] And there's a lot of really funny genuine people that do comedy.
[00:59:46 --> 00:59:50] But, and, and they can do, they can get up there and you have enough attention on to do the comedy.
[00:59:50 --> 00:59:52] But they don't want to be like, hey, look at me.
[00:59:52 --> 00:59:53] I mean, I fight that constantly.
[00:59:53 --> 00:59:56] Even like that little video where we were going in the playing yesterday.
[00:59:56 --> 00:59:59] And I said, playing by day, Joe Roganpot, you know, like,
[00:59:59 --> 01:00:04] I, you, you, you, you, you.
[01:00:00 --> 01:00:02] I don't even just make in little videos like that.
[01:00:02 --> 01:00:03] I feel way out of place.
[01:00:03 --> 01:00:07] Like, I don't want people to think like I'm saying,
[01:00:07 --> 01:00:08] hey, look at me, you know.
[01:00:08 --> 01:00:10] I mean, that's why I try to go through these periods
[01:00:10 --> 01:00:11] where I just don't post or I'm like,
[01:00:11 --> 01:00:13] I'm like, you were in a regular airport.
[01:00:13 --> 01:00:14] Yeah, the worst.
[01:00:14 --> 01:00:16] The worst is when people are doing those things
[01:00:16 --> 01:00:18] in front of a private jet, I'm like,
[01:00:18 --> 01:00:20] okay, we get it, you're rich.
[01:00:20 --> 01:00:22] You know, if people try to take photos of me in front of a jet,
[01:00:22 --> 01:00:26] I'm like, I'm not, I'm so not into this, I'm not.
[01:00:26 --> 01:00:28] I don't like the attention.
[01:00:28 --> 01:00:29] I don't want it.
[01:00:29 --> 01:00:30] I don't need it.
[01:00:30 --> 01:00:32] It's, which is weird, because I got a lot of it.
[01:00:32 --> 01:00:35] And I think it's probably why I don't want it.
[01:00:35 --> 01:00:36] Because I'm not looking for it.
[01:00:36 --> 01:00:37] Yeah, but you're also able to,
[01:00:37 --> 01:00:39] you're channeling it out through all these other.
[01:00:39 --> 01:00:40] I mean, think about all the things
[01:00:40 --> 01:00:43] that you've influenced and been a part of and done,
[01:00:43 --> 01:00:45] even just see this podcast and all the conversations
[01:00:45 --> 01:00:46] had in the information shared.
[01:00:46 --> 01:00:48] Like, it's not like you're just posted a bunch of pictures
[01:00:48 --> 01:00:50] with you shirt off, like, hey, look at me.
[01:00:50 --> 01:00:52] Like, you're using it.
[01:00:52 --> 01:00:53] I mean, I don't know.
[01:00:53 --> 01:00:55] I almost would say, I don't know that it's a coincidence
[01:00:55 --> 01:00:57] that you got put in this spot for a lot of reasons.
[01:00:57 --> 01:00:59] I mean, there's a lot, you probably don't even look
[01:00:59 --> 01:01:01] at it that way, but there's a lot of important things
[01:01:01 --> 01:01:02] that come out of this.
[01:01:02 --> 01:01:05] And all the other podcasts you've inspired that have done,
[01:01:05 --> 01:01:08] I mean, gosh, dude, there's no way to even calculate what you've,
[01:01:08 --> 01:01:10] if you'd never been born, there's no way to calculate
[01:01:10 --> 01:01:11] how many different things would be now.
[01:01:11 --> 01:01:14] Well, that's important to think about, though, you know,
[01:01:14 --> 01:01:17] like it's sort of, but from my perspective,
[01:01:17 --> 01:01:20] I was just one piece in this thing that happened.
[01:01:20 --> 01:01:21] Yeah.
[01:01:21 --> 01:01:24] And, you know, that's why I always have my friend Adam Curry on,
[01:01:24 --> 01:01:25] who's the original.
[01:01:25 --> 01:01:27] He's the pod father without him.
[01:01:27 --> 01:01:28] There would be none of this.
[01:01:28 --> 01:01:30] He figured out a way to do this.
[01:01:30 --> 01:01:33] And, you know, and then also Anthony Cumia,
[01:01:33 --> 01:01:35] from Opian Anthony and Tom Green.
[01:01:35 --> 01:01:38] Those are those are my number one influences.
[01:01:38 --> 01:01:41] And then Adam Corolla already had a podcast when I started.
[01:01:41 --> 01:01:45] I was like, oh, Adam went from radio to the internet.
[01:01:45 --> 01:01:46] Maybe I could do that.
[01:01:46 --> 01:01:47] I remember going to his place.
[01:01:47 --> 01:01:49] And, oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:01:49 --> 01:01:51] It's back when we were doing it on a little laptop.
[01:01:51 --> 01:01:53] I'm like, wow, Adam, I got a real studio.
[01:01:53 --> 01:01:55] It's got a poison chip.
[01:01:55 --> 01:01:57] And then, you know, we just kept doing it.
[01:01:57 --> 01:01:58] Just kept doing it.
[01:01:58 --> 01:02:00] You know, and then eventually it was webcams.
[01:02:00 --> 01:02:02] Okay, now it's not just the laptop camera.
[01:02:02 --> 01:02:04] It's actual webcams.
[01:02:04 --> 01:02:06] Okay. Now, maybe she had like real cameras.
[01:02:06 --> 01:02:07] Okay, let's get real cameras.
[01:02:07 --> 01:02:09] And then like, maybe she got a fucking studio.
[01:02:09 --> 01:02:11] So we tried it at the ice house for a little bit.
[01:02:11 --> 01:02:12] Like, maybe she got another place.
[01:02:12 --> 01:02:13] Then we got another place and I'm like,
[01:02:13 --> 01:02:15] I think I need a warehouse.
[01:02:15 --> 01:02:17] And then I'm like, I think I need armed security.
[01:02:17 --> 01:02:23] I think I need fucking special ops guys around me all the time.
[01:02:23 --> 01:02:25] And then it just kept going, man.
[01:02:25 --> 01:02:27] I remember the moment I've talked about this before,
[01:02:27 --> 01:02:29] but I didn't understand what was happening
[01:02:29 --> 01:02:32] until one day I was on stage in Chicago.
[01:02:32 --> 01:02:35] And I think this was 2012.
[01:02:35 --> 01:02:37] So I think I think it was around then.
[01:02:37 --> 01:02:40] So the podcast was only three years old.
[01:02:40 --> 01:02:42] And I didn't realize how many people watched it
[01:02:42 --> 01:02:43] or listened.
[01:02:43 --> 01:02:45] A lot of it was listening at the time.
[01:02:45 --> 01:02:49] Because I wasn't, I don't look at the numbers.
[01:02:49 --> 01:02:50] I just kind of key.
[01:02:50 --> 01:02:52] I feel like, well, that's bad for you.
[01:02:52 --> 01:02:53] You know, reading the comments, looking at the numbers.
[01:02:53 --> 01:02:55] I just like, do what you do.
[01:02:55 --> 01:02:56] That's why I do it exactly the same way.
[01:02:56 --> 01:02:59] I have a bunch of people on the no one has ever heard of.
[01:02:59 --> 01:03:01] And then a few bonos and stuff, you know,
[01:03:01 --> 01:03:03] every now and then I'll have Russell Crowe
[01:03:03 --> 01:03:05] on something crazy when we're all that crazy.
[01:03:05 --> 01:03:06] Dennis Quades here.
[01:03:06 --> 01:03:07] Yeah, you're Mel Gibson one.
[01:03:07 --> 01:03:08] Yeah.
[01:03:08 --> 01:03:09] He's the best.
[01:03:09 --> 01:03:12] But I was on stage in Chicago and I was telling the story
[01:03:12 --> 01:03:13] about the podcast.
[01:03:13 --> 01:03:15] I go, how many guys listen to the podcast?
[01:03:15 --> 01:03:19] Anyway, Chad was like 3,700 people in this place.
[01:03:19 --> 01:03:20] And they were all screaming.
[01:03:20 --> 01:03:24] And I went, whoa, yeah, that's when I realized.
[01:03:24 --> 01:03:27] Like at that moment, I was like, holy shit.
[01:03:27 --> 01:03:30] How big is this thing going to get?
[01:03:30 --> 01:03:31] And this is another funny thing.
[01:03:31 --> 01:03:32] When I went over the Spotify,
[01:03:32 --> 01:03:34] I was trying to get 10% less famous.
[01:03:34 --> 01:03:36] That was my goal.
[01:03:36 --> 01:03:39] My goal was to fade away.
[01:03:39 --> 01:03:40] My goal was like if someone has to pay me
[01:03:40 --> 01:03:42] and you have to go to this app to get it,
[01:03:42 --> 01:03:43] all the people that are getting at the other apps
[01:03:43 --> 01:03:44] are probably stop listening.
[01:03:44 --> 01:03:45] I think this would be great.
[01:03:45 --> 01:03:46] I'll get all the money.
[01:03:46 --> 01:03:48] And I'll just fucking drift into this place
[01:03:48 --> 01:03:50] where it's only like the hardcore fans
[01:03:50 --> 01:03:52] that make the track over to Spotify.
[01:03:52 --> 01:03:55] And then this fucking COVID thing happened.
[01:03:55 --> 01:03:56] Remember in the beginning of the podcast,
[01:03:56 --> 01:03:59] we lost 50% of our views and Jamie was on a hot panic.
[01:04:04 --> 01:04:05] Yeah, that's exactly what I meant earlier
[01:04:05 --> 01:04:07] about not putting a lot of songs out.
[01:04:07 --> 01:04:09] There's like a, there's some cool place
[01:04:09 --> 01:04:12] where you can be where you have your real fans
[01:04:12 --> 01:04:13] and you're having fun, but you're not
[01:04:13 --> 01:04:16] into all the sensationalism, all the crap, you know,
[01:04:16 --> 01:04:18] like, you can avoid all that.
[01:04:18 --> 01:04:19] You're a real guy.
[01:04:19 --> 01:04:19] You're a real dude.
[01:04:19 --> 01:04:22] I think one of the ways that the world has prepared you
[01:04:22 --> 01:04:27] for this is that you've lived a normal life for a long time.
[01:04:27 --> 01:04:30] You know, a normal life with no life performances,
[01:04:30 --> 01:04:32] no notoriety, no fame, no nothing.
[01:04:32 --> 01:04:36] You developed like when people wanna hear working man songs,
[01:04:36 --> 01:04:41] you fucking know Bruce Springsteen isn't a working man.
[01:04:41 --> 01:04:42] Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:04:42 --> 01:04:45] Like you probably was never really a working man.
[01:04:45 --> 01:04:46] He was never working on the docs.
[01:04:46 --> 01:04:47] You know what I mean?
[01:04:47 --> 01:04:50] He was never really a guy grinded it out.
[01:04:50 --> 01:04:53] He became famous pretty fucking young, you know?
[01:04:53 --> 01:04:56] They Bruce Springsteen in the East Street Band,
[01:04:56 --> 01:04:59] they got hot early, like they're great.
[01:04:59 --> 01:05:00] Don't get me wrong.
[01:05:00 --> 01:05:01] I mean, especially it's early,
[01:05:01 --> 01:05:03] it's not born to run fuck.
[01:05:03 --> 01:05:05] He's got some jams dude.
[01:05:05 --> 01:05:08] He's got some great songs, you know, brilliant disguise.
[01:05:08 --> 01:05:10] Oh, fucking love that song.
[01:05:10 --> 01:05:14] But you're a real working man.
[01:05:14 --> 01:05:17] Like you were a real working man
[01:05:17 --> 01:05:19] when you made rich men north of Richmond.
[01:05:19 --> 01:05:21] Like that is real.
[01:05:21 --> 01:05:22] And you can't fake that.
[01:05:22 --> 01:05:23] And people want that.
[01:05:23 --> 01:05:25] They want a fucking trucker hat.
[01:05:25 --> 01:05:26] They want ripped jeans.
[01:05:26 --> 01:05:29] They don't want like ripped jeans that are ripped from work.
[01:05:29 --> 01:05:29] You know what I mean?
[01:05:29 --> 01:05:32] They don't like real oil stains on your knees
[01:05:32 --> 01:05:34] because you're fixing your own car, you know?
[01:05:34 --> 01:05:37] Like that's what people want in this world.
[01:05:37 --> 01:05:39] They want authenticity.
[01:05:39 --> 01:05:41] And it's possible to maintain authenticity
[01:05:41 --> 01:05:42] regardless of how big you get.
[01:05:42 --> 01:05:43] It is possible.
[01:05:43 --> 01:05:44] And I think you can do it.
[01:05:44 --> 01:05:47] I think you can do it because you got here later in life.
[01:05:47 --> 01:05:50] You got here and lived a real life.
[01:05:50 --> 01:05:53] And then you made it into magical fantasy land
[01:05:53 --> 01:05:54] where we all live.
[01:05:54 --> 01:05:56] Yeah, well, the thing that I've gotten the most from you,
[01:05:56 --> 01:05:58] like I say, I don't look at my streaming numbers,
[01:05:58 --> 01:05:59] or anything, you know, that's what I mean.
[01:05:59 --> 01:06:02] Like when I finally did go back and look at Spotify,
[01:06:02 --> 01:06:05] like I after a year or a year and a half later
[01:06:05 --> 01:06:08] is just like, oh my god, like I'm still the thing, you know?
[01:06:08 --> 01:06:10] But some I agree with you there.
[01:06:10 --> 01:06:11] I don't look at the numbers.
[01:06:12 --> 01:06:14] I do catch myself reading a lot of the comments,
[01:06:14 --> 01:06:16] but only because a lot of them are important.
[01:06:16 --> 01:06:18] And I think some of the stories in them are important for me
[01:06:18 --> 01:06:21] to, I don't want to completely isolate myself from that.
[01:06:21 --> 01:06:24] And like I said, I also really like some of the negative ones, too.
[01:06:24 --> 01:06:26] I think negative ones are a lot less now than they used to be.
[01:06:26 --> 01:06:28] It was just really early on, people didn't understand
[01:06:28 --> 01:06:29] how everything happened.
[01:06:29 --> 01:06:31] And I really didn't understand it either.
[01:06:31 --> 01:06:32] That's why it's like whatever, you know?
[01:06:32 --> 01:06:37] But moving forward now, yeah, I've got a good, like core team of people.
[01:06:37 --> 01:06:39] I've got Draven from RadioWV.
[01:06:39 --> 01:06:41] I've got two or three people on staff.
[01:06:41 --> 01:06:44] I don't have a management company or a publicist, you know?
[01:06:44 --> 01:06:45] But that's the key.
[01:06:45 --> 01:06:48] I'm keeping it real low.
[01:06:48 --> 01:06:50] Well, I mean, it just amazed me when I came here for the first time
[01:06:50 --> 01:06:51] and saw the staff you have.
[01:06:51 --> 01:06:54] And then like, meet and lex, you know, lex does all of it.
[01:06:54 --> 01:06:55] He even turns his own cameras on.
[01:06:55 --> 01:06:57] And there's only lex in the whole place.
[01:06:57 --> 01:07:00] It's like, gosh, I don't need all these.
[01:07:00 --> 01:07:03] It's like a lot of those positions and jobs and services
[01:07:03 --> 01:07:06] that musicians use, I think they don't realize that they don't even need.
[01:07:06 --> 01:07:08] They just are like, oh, that's how it is in music.
[01:07:08 --> 01:07:09] That's what I want to check.
[01:07:09 --> 01:07:12] I want to, yeah, I don't know exactly.
[01:07:12 --> 01:07:14] It eliminates the executive influence.
[01:07:14 --> 01:07:16] It eliminates the corporate mindset.
[01:07:16 --> 01:07:18] It eliminates that because there's always going to be a person
[01:07:18 --> 01:07:21] that wants you to make a decision that's better for you financially.
[01:07:21 --> 01:07:25] Whereas like your instincts are guiding you towards the artistic decision.
[01:07:25 --> 01:07:26] Yeah.
[01:07:26 --> 01:07:29] And anytime those people get in the mix, they fuck everything up.
[01:07:29 --> 01:07:30] I'll give you a great example.
[01:07:30 --> 01:07:33] It's like the only, it's the only, like, call out on here that's negative.
[01:07:33 --> 01:07:39] That I'll say it all, is that just to show like how stuck in the mud,
[01:07:39 --> 01:07:43] the industry is and how much I think it's going to change in the near future
[01:07:43 --> 01:07:46] is leading up to the score and full release.
[01:07:46 --> 01:07:52] Me and Draven had went back and found about 30 or 40 people who just, without us even
[01:07:52 --> 01:07:54] knowing who they were, made the Richmond reaction videos.
[01:07:54 --> 01:07:59] And they were a big part of the push-up, especially long-term, you know, like,
[01:07:59 --> 01:08:01] people on TikTok and stuff that had made these videos.
[01:08:01 --> 01:08:07] And so I don't have, I own 100% of my publishing, you know, all the music's mind, thankfully.
[01:08:07 --> 01:08:11] I have my own label, technically, that collects the money, but you have to use a publishing
[01:08:11 --> 01:08:14] administration deal in order to collect money like overseas.
[01:08:14 --> 01:08:18] I don't know if you're familiar, if it's the same in comedy, but like, yeah, most any
[01:08:18 --> 01:08:21] musician, whether you're independent or you're with somebody, you have to have some kind
[01:08:21 --> 01:08:22] of pub admin.
[01:08:22 --> 01:08:26] And it's basically somebody that goes and helps you collect publishing money from
[01:08:26 --> 01:08:29] over, basically mostly from overseas is the way to understand, like all these obscure
[01:08:29 --> 01:08:32] places that money exists.
[01:08:32 --> 01:08:34] So Warner Chapel does it for me for 9%, right?
[01:08:34 --> 01:08:37] So they go collect all the stuff, they keep 9% of it.
[01:08:37 --> 01:08:41] They're the same to me as if I had a commercial landscape and company, manage in a property
[01:08:41 --> 01:08:42] for me.
[01:08:42 --> 01:08:47] So all I asked them to do was, hey, Warner Chapel, this six foot square of grass, where
[01:08:47 --> 01:08:51] all these reaction videos exist, just please whitelist these people, so they don't get
[01:08:51 --> 01:08:52] copyrighted.
[01:08:52 --> 01:08:55] I want them to actually make the money they make on the Scornful reaction videos, you
[01:08:55 --> 01:08:56] know?
[01:08:56 --> 01:08:59] Like, I don't, I don't feel right if they're going to go and make a Scornful Woman
[01:08:59 --> 01:09:04] reaction video or play drums over it or whatever, I don't want to take 50% of what,
[01:09:04 --> 01:09:07] you know what I mean, just don't copy, just whitelist them.
[01:09:07 --> 01:09:11] And it should have been, okay, great, good idea, you know?
[01:09:11 --> 01:09:15] And instead they just said, we can't do that, but it's for your protection.
[01:09:15 --> 01:09:21] So because they wanted the money, so they get a percentage and how do they, well, they
[01:09:21 --> 01:09:24] take 9% off of what I get.
[01:09:24 --> 01:09:29] But I tried to explain to them, we'll know, like, in the business sense, I even counter
[01:09:29 --> 01:09:30] argue to them.
[01:09:30 --> 01:09:32] And I was like, well, let's think about it in the business sense.
[01:09:32 --> 01:09:36] This little bit of money, right, that you're not going to collect off these reaction videos,
[01:09:36 --> 01:09:39] we'll generate, who knows how much traffic to the music, which is where the money
[01:09:39 --> 01:09:40] you really want.
[01:09:40 --> 01:09:43] And it shouldn't matter anyway, it's not there, it's not their shit to decide on
[01:09:43 --> 01:09:44] it's mine.
[01:09:44 --> 01:09:48] It's the same thing as if I hired a guy to cut the grass at my commercial property and
[01:09:48 --> 01:09:52] said, don't cut the six foot square and they're like, no, we're cutting all the grass.
[01:09:52 --> 01:09:57] And it's for your, so I had to get my attorney involved and spend like four grand and they
[01:09:57 --> 01:09:59] whitelist it them for 30 days.
[01:09:59 --> 01:10:00] And so I'm like, okay.
[01:10:00 --> 01:10:07] Okay, like that's why that's why all of you industry people are like so, you know, it's like that's why this is happening. That's why it's like
[01:10:08 --> 01:10:19] I don't know, just they don't care at all about the little guy or the people who are like doing all the work. They just I just picture all these like stinky library and type old people sitting around a table like
[01:10:20 --> 01:10:29] And you know, they can make all this money and make all these horrible decisions and poor all these millions of dollars in the songs they don't work and it doesn't matter because it's just like it it's not there they don't care they're getting their big salary
[01:10:30 --> 01:10:32] Yeah, so
[01:10:32 --> 01:10:37] So yeah, it's just even even in the even in the most menous school relationships. I've had a Nashville
[01:10:37 --> 01:10:43] I get resistance and push back and like it's on I don't know like why wouldn't they want me to whitelist those 30 people?
[01:10:43 --> 01:10:47] It's just a little stupid stuff like that that I've constantly dealt with so I've just decided now like I don't need
[01:10:47 --> 01:10:52] I just don't want to do anything in the music like I don't even need to be in the music business like in that sense, you know
[01:10:52 --> 01:10:56] I just I write my songs. I've recorded them. I got to do my shows and have fun
[01:10:56 --> 01:11:02] But I don't even need to follow any of the model of what of what like a traditional musician artist person would have done
[01:11:02 --> 01:11:11] You definitely don't need to do it that way. It's not necessary and you have the right mindset is that all those reaction videos
[01:11:11 --> 01:11:14] Just get more people to listen to your music. It's that's fast
[01:11:14 --> 01:11:21] But those are real those people were like real fans who went and did it not because they were trying to get traffic or money or whatever
[01:11:21 --> 01:11:28] They just like liked it and wanted to push it and so the least I can do is not take 50% of their stuff and like it just
[01:11:28 --> 01:11:33] But isn't that crazy that it's like there's nobody's ever done that I guess like before
[01:11:33 --> 01:11:40] They were just acting like that was just the craziest thing in the world. So I ended up releasing the scornful song through a company called sound on
[01:11:40 --> 01:11:47] Which is like the music distribution side of TikTok which seems like something I would never want to do
[01:11:47 --> 01:11:54] But they give me the flexibility to go and like and do all that they don't care because they're not music industry people
[01:11:54 --> 01:11:58] They're just social media people so I uploaded it through them basically
[01:11:58 --> 01:12:01] So I'm still I own all 100% of the rights. It's all my stuff
[01:12:01 --> 01:12:03] I don't have any deals or records or labels or anything
[01:12:03 --> 01:12:06] But they push it to the streaming services for me and they do all the stuff
[01:12:06 --> 01:12:10] So that way I'm not even having to use a music company to push my music
[01:12:10 --> 01:12:16] I can kind of just like not even be there at all. You know like not even being Nashville at all. That's the goal is just to get
[01:12:17 --> 01:12:21] And so now that I've got data from you know since Richmond basically and have
[01:12:22 --> 01:12:29] Learned a lot my goal long term is I want I'm in as always putting new music out and right stuff and you know
[01:12:29 --> 01:12:32] But it's gonna come in spurts and there'll be times where people won't see a lot of me
[01:12:32 --> 01:12:35] But I'm gonna be in the background with other people like I want to help
[01:12:35 --> 01:12:38] I want to find these people on TikTok that have like a hundred followers
[01:12:38 --> 01:12:42] But I know that they've got what it takes and get with like driving and some of these other people
[01:12:42 --> 01:12:46] I've met and like help them write some really good songs and record them and put them out and push them and just like
[01:12:46 --> 01:12:51] I would love to plant like 10 or 15 people in the music like give them everything I can give them to
[01:12:52 --> 01:12:59] To push them forward and make like that way it doesn't feel like I'm I'm the guy in the spotlight trying to like I feel like I'm just in a I feel like I'm like the most
[01:13:00 --> 01:13:06] I don't know these companies have got like all these employees and all this money and all this backing and it's literally like four or five of us taking them
[01:13:06 --> 01:13:14] I just I don't know to me I just think I I think there's strength in numbers if I could help more artists push forward and like help them break that
[01:13:14 --> 01:13:19] Cycle too that it would just some it would be like a multiple occasion factor on this whole thing. That's kind of what
[01:13:19 --> 01:13:26] That's gonna be kind of my next thing I get into is is helping produce music and doing festivals and like
[01:13:27 --> 01:13:34] Starting a label basically kind of sort of that's fucking awesome, but a non predatory one like even even when Draven put somebody on radio
[01:13:34 --> 01:13:36] WV if they get 30,000 views
[01:13:36 --> 01:13:40] There's already people trying to sign them like they just want control of every new thing that's
[01:13:41 --> 01:13:44] You know that's what they were trying to do to you right off the bat
[01:13:44 --> 01:13:47] I don't cut it is terrifying too to not do it just like I just
[01:13:48 --> 01:13:52] I felt like I was just everything it was everything in me felt wrong doing it, you know
[01:13:52 --> 01:13:56] But I just decided that I didn't care about it and that it I just you know
[01:13:56 --> 01:14:03] I remember being very adamant at the beginning that every decision moving forward was based off the fact that I wasn't scared to go back to my old job
[01:14:03 --> 01:14:09] If I had to because I'd rather go back to my old job and be me then go to Republic but just be Republic's little bitch
[01:14:09 --> 01:14:14] You know I have to do everything they want and say everything like and also seeing where all your profits go and
[01:14:15 --> 01:14:20] Realizing that you got hoodwinked into these deals because these deals when they give you a big chunk of money
[01:14:20 --> 01:14:24] You got to pay that money back. Yeah, that's all just an advance. Well if I had went with a label
[01:14:25 --> 01:14:30] I would have been a lot bigger though because they would have made me push 30 songs out of year and they would have put all this
[01:14:30 --> 01:14:36] Marketing money into and they would have kind of inflated me into this big fake like every other country superstar
[01:14:36 --> 01:14:41] And so it feels a lot better just kind of being a little little scaled back a little smaller
[01:14:41 --> 01:14:46] But yeah collecting 100% of my money and then also just knowing that I don't have a boss anymore other than
[01:14:46 --> 01:14:48] You know than the man upstairs like I don't
[01:14:49 --> 01:14:52] Gosh dude. I mean like I imagine how you know
[01:14:52 --> 01:14:57] I've heard stories from bands as stuff now that have told me that they've went and had to record music like under a label contract
[01:14:57 --> 01:15:02] And really didn't like the way the album turned out but still had to release it anyway like oh my gosh
[01:15:02 --> 01:15:06] That would just make me to have to put music out that I didn't think was good
[01:15:06 --> 01:15:12] They're gonna be loaded. I think I'm gonna just find it. Yeah, yeah, you don't want other people
[01:15:12 --> 01:15:15] Especially financial people ever be involved in your art
[01:15:16 --> 01:15:23] Ever even if they're good people like now we can we're gonna beneficial deal for both people. No, it's not gonna be beneficial for you
[01:15:23 --> 01:15:26] It's gonna influence you and it's gonna turn you in one way or another
[01:15:26 --> 01:15:30] It's not the way you would have originally gone on your own and the reason there's so much money in music is because
[01:15:30 --> 01:15:35] Music such a big part of us as human beings and it's like it's so funny the first thing they do when they
[01:15:36 --> 01:15:40] Sign somebody is like trying to rip their identity away and it's like you they it's like the labels don't understand
[01:15:40 --> 01:15:44] That it's the identity of the person that put him in the position. They're in in the first place
[01:15:44 --> 01:15:46] It's like you said there were a laid ability of it, you know
[01:15:47 --> 01:15:50] Well, there's also people have this instinct to try to influence people
[01:15:50 --> 01:15:55] So there's one of the things that executives do in the beginning when someone's just starting they like you know what you should do
[01:15:55 --> 01:16:00] You should get a crew cut. I think you'd look great with a crew cut and then like the crew cut was my idea
[01:16:00 --> 01:16:03] Yeah, you know something about Oliver's crew cut everybody loves that crew cut. Yeah
[01:16:03 --> 01:16:07] It's just like he doesn't give a fuck about his hair. That was my idea. Yeah, you know
[01:16:07 --> 01:16:11] There's a little of that because like people are easily influenced because like in the beginning
[01:16:11 --> 01:16:16] You're not sure like I can't even believe what got signed like I'm not gonna be a star these people all here for me
[01:16:16 --> 01:16:18] You know and they'll fucking
[01:16:18 --> 01:16:20] Get in there. That's happened to me. I mean I brought
[01:16:21 --> 01:16:27] Around February or so I hired this management company that stayed they were my management company for three weeks
[01:16:27 --> 01:16:29] So that kind of tells you how well things worked
[01:16:29 --> 01:16:35] But he was super nice like loved everything I was doing and then as soon as I got as soon as I started with him
[01:16:35 --> 01:16:37] He was telling other people that I know like yeah
[01:16:37 --> 01:16:42] We got to figure out how to make him cool and he needs to put like 40 or 50 songs out this year
[01:16:42 --> 01:16:44] And they were wanting me to make the social media posts like
[01:16:44 --> 01:16:50] Complimenting Beyonce's country album because he thought it was gonna get me in a position like it's exactly what you're saying
[01:16:50 --> 01:16:56] It's just like and I just told him I was like dude. I if I wanted to just be if I just wanted to be somebody's little like
[01:16:57 --> 01:17:00] Somebody's little puppet. There's a lot I would have taken a lot more money for it like you know
[01:17:00 --> 01:17:03] I'm independent so I don't have to do that. It's like
[01:17:04 --> 01:17:08] But that's like and it's like the thing is is I don't need to be cool
[01:17:08 --> 01:17:11] It's okay that I'm kind of lame and I just but I'm just me and you know it is what it is
[01:17:11 --> 01:17:14] It's like I don't have to I don't have to try to get on the internet and pretend to be cool
[01:17:14 --> 01:17:21] There's a cool man. Stop this. You're cool. You're not lame. You're not lame at all. What the fuck are you talking about?
[01:17:21 --> 01:17:25] You're a cool guy. You make great music and you're thanks fun hang out with how you how you lame
[01:17:26 --> 01:17:30] Because you're normal guess what everybody's normal. It's a ruse Beyonce's normal too
[01:17:30 --> 01:17:33] She takes horrible shit. I'm sure we all do we all do
[01:17:34 --> 01:17:38] It's there's humans human beings man. This illusion of celebrity
[01:17:39 --> 01:17:43] It's complete total nonsense. Dude. That's the best thing. Yeah, everybody takes horrible shit
[01:17:44 --> 01:17:51] You want to bring gummy I was hoping you had some of the Alex Jones ones. Well, he's just an on it once the new
[01:17:51 --> 01:17:56] They're Alphabre and gummies. We just got him how is Alex doing he's the use great wash a lot of weight
[01:17:56 --> 01:18:00] I saw he's getting like yeah, yeah, he's ready for the next one John Johnson's training
[01:18:00 --> 01:18:04] I really yeah, he gets up every morning. He works out for fucking hours. He's lost
[01:18:04 --> 01:18:09] I think he's lost 70 pounds at this point. He looks fantastic man. Yeah
[01:18:09 --> 01:18:14] He looks fantastic. He looks like he's 20 years younger people think this is we're a footic as you know
[01:18:14 --> 01:18:16] His whole business is conspiracy theorists
[01:18:16 --> 01:18:21] conspiracy that Alex has been replaced. Yeah. Yeah listen folks. That's real Alex
[01:18:21 --> 01:18:26] I've watched every step of the way in my friend train some so I can tell you for a fact
[01:18:26 --> 01:18:31] That is the real Alex Jones quit drinking quit fucking around quitting bad food
[01:18:31 --> 01:18:36] He's eating healthy food now. He works out every day. It's like no-o's epic no bullshit no shortcuts
[01:18:37 --> 01:18:44] He did it the right way. He looks great. Yeah, yeah, he's he's definitely he's definitely one of my bucket list people with me
[01:18:44 --> 01:18:50] I can do she to Alex. Yeah, we can make that happen for sure 100%. It'd be just not about that. Just be holy
[01:18:50 --> 01:18:54] That's done. Done. Done. Nice. Yeah. We'll look that up
[01:18:55 --> 01:19:00] Be prepared that'd be interesting conversation. Yeah, cuz off air. He's just like he's on air
[01:19:00 --> 01:19:02] He's a he's a that's Alex Jones. He's ready to go
[01:19:02 --> 01:19:05] Yeah, Billy and fucking what Bill Gates doing right now
[01:19:07 --> 01:19:11] How does he get in the way with that? Well, but thanks do it to pay off all the mass media
[01:19:11 --> 01:19:14] If you see there's a $350 million donation that he gave it all
[01:19:14 --> 01:19:21] Media companies like what 350 is that real? Then Jamie will look it up like whole leaf. Yeah, no, he's he's right a lot of the time
[01:19:21 --> 01:19:23] He's right most of the time except that one big one
[01:19:23 --> 01:19:24] But other than yeah
[01:19:24 --> 01:19:28] But he's gonna get that with like they say like the kids say you get that with those big jobs, you know
[01:19:28 --> 01:19:37] What also I think happens and this is I think this is 100% real is that there are a bunch of fake stories that get propagated to people
[01:19:37 --> 01:19:43] That are really invested in conspiracy theories hoping that those people promote those fake conspiracy theories and then get out
[01:19:43 --> 01:19:52] As being wrong, yeah, you know, I think you can get caught up in that and then I also think if you're real quick to not check
[01:19:52 --> 01:19:55] And I'm guilty of that all the time to see if something's legit
[01:19:55 --> 01:19:59] You know, that's one of the vital roles of Jamie plays like Jay like
[01:20:00 --> 01:20:00] Maybe that's not real.
[01:20:00 --> 01:20:03] Like what, why are you fucking this up, Jamie?
[01:20:03 --> 01:20:04] Like we want it to be a real, right?
[01:20:04 --> 01:20:06] You want a nice juicy conspiracy to be real.
[01:20:08 --> 01:20:11] And then also, at the time of the Sandy Hook stop,
[01:20:11 --> 01:20:13] he was drinking like a lot.
[01:20:13 --> 01:20:16] And I think he was genuinely overwhelmed
[01:20:16 --> 01:20:18] by all the real stuff that he was finding.
[01:20:18 --> 01:20:21] You know, when he's getting into the Iraq war
[01:20:21 --> 01:20:22] and all these different things,
[01:20:22 --> 01:20:24] it's like he was just overwhelmed man.
[01:20:24 --> 01:20:27] I think he had a psychotic break, you know,
[01:20:27 --> 01:20:29] and he'll be the first to say that too.
[01:20:30 --> 01:20:32] It's like when you're your whole business
[01:20:32 --> 01:20:35] is uncovering insane conspiracies.
[01:20:35 --> 01:20:38] If everybody thinks you're out of your fucking mind,
[01:20:38 --> 01:20:39] and then 20 years later,
[01:20:39 --> 01:20:44] they're like, holy, shitty was right about every step of the way.
[01:20:44 --> 01:20:47] He was telling me about central bank digital currency,
[01:20:47 --> 01:20:49] connected to a social credit score system
[01:20:49 --> 01:20:51] that it's game over, because they'll lock you in
[01:20:51 --> 01:20:52] just like they've done with China.
[01:20:52 --> 01:20:56] And he was like, seeing this like a decade plus ago.
[01:20:56 --> 01:20:57] I was like, what?
[01:20:57 --> 01:21:01] Yeah, it's great, like the guy before him that I think,
[01:21:01 --> 01:21:03] I think the two of them actually didn't get along,
[01:21:03 --> 01:21:06] but I always, if I ever do meet Alex,
[01:21:06 --> 01:21:07] I was gonna ask him out that is Bill Cooper,
[01:21:07 --> 01:21:09] but he was a guy who kind of came before Alex,
[01:21:09 --> 01:21:10] that's something.
[01:21:10 --> 01:21:12] He'd be holding a pair of horses, right?
[01:21:12 --> 01:21:12] Yeah.
[01:21:12 --> 01:21:14] But yeah, even back then, it just,
[01:21:14 --> 01:21:17] most of it seemed like total madness back then.
[01:21:17 --> 01:21:20] And now it's like, but it's just sort of like,
[01:21:20 --> 01:21:21] I laugh about when I was a kid,
[01:21:21 --> 01:21:23] everyone thought that Michael Jackson was the big,
[01:21:23 --> 01:21:26] like sexually perverted guy, and who knows with Mike,
[01:21:26 --> 01:21:29] but now I look at Michael as like this,
[01:21:29 --> 01:21:31] just kid that was put in this terrible position
[01:21:31 --> 01:21:33] from a child up, and now all these other musicians
[01:21:33 --> 01:21:35] that you wouldn't even think are the sex predators are.
[01:21:35 --> 01:21:37] It's just kind of like, we just don't really know
[01:21:37 --> 01:21:39] much of anything anyway, but yeah, like with that.
[01:21:39 --> 01:21:41] With the Michael Jackson thing too,
[01:21:41 --> 01:21:43] his doctor said that he was chemically castrated
[01:21:43 --> 01:21:47] when he was young, to maintain his voice.
[01:21:47 --> 01:21:51] And I believe him, because that totally makes sense.
[01:21:51 --> 01:21:55] You look at his frame, his really thin frame,
[01:21:55 --> 01:21:58] where it doesn't really get as any testosterone.
[01:21:58 --> 01:22:01] Look at all his brothers, his brothers are like thick,
[01:22:01 --> 01:22:02] like manly.
[01:22:02 --> 01:22:04] What does chemically castrated mean exactly?
[01:22:04 --> 01:22:06] Well, do I even want to say something?
[01:22:06 --> 01:22:07] It's hormone blockers.
[01:22:07 --> 01:22:10] That's exactly what they're doing to trans kids now.
[01:22:10 --> 01:22:10] Yeah.
[01:22:10 --> 01:22:11] It's the same thing.
[01:22:11 --> 01:22:13] And that's why Michael Jackson had that voice.
[01:22:13 --> 01:22:17] It's very similar to a castraught as voice.
[01:22:17 --> 01:22:19] Do you know what a castraught it was?
[01:22:19 --> 01:22:22] So these kids in opera were faster.
[01:22:22 --> 01:22:23] Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:23 --> 01:22:26] And there's only one available recording, I think.
[01:22:26 --> 01:22:28] It's just like one guy, right?
[01:22:28 --> 01:22:29] Have you ever heard it?
[01:22:29 --> 01:22:31] A long time ago, yeah, I'd like to hear it.
[01:22:31 --> 01:22:33] Let's listen to some of it,
[01:22:33 --> 01:22:34] because it's fucking creepy.
[01:22:34 --> 01:22:37] I've just heard stories about like about that being the thing
[01:22:37 --> 01:22:39] that we can get to a voice children,
[01:22:39 --> 01:22:41] so that they never had testosterone,
[01:22:41 --> 01:22:44] so that their body never really developed.
[01:22:44 --> 01:22:49] And then they would have them maintain that young voice,
[01:22:49 --> 01:22:51] that high pitch that's only possible.
[01:22:51 --> 01:22:54] If you don't develop, the deepness that comes with,
[01:22:54 --> 01:22:58] that's why when trans men, when women start taking testosterone,
[01:22:58 --> 01:23:01] their voice starts getting deeper, things start getting weird,
[01:23:01 --> 01:23:04] and they start getting very dwayne Johnson.
[01:23:04 --> 01:23:05] You know, it's like that's testosterone.
[01:23:05 --> 01:23:09] That's what it has on your voice.
[01:23:09 --> 01:23:12] And these poor fox,
[01:23:14 --> 01:23:16] Alessandro Mareski.
[01:23:17 --> 01:23:22] I don't wanna, I don't wanna go.
[01:23:22 --> 01:23:24] Don't make fun of them.
[01:23:24 --> 01:23:26] It's a beautiful woman.
[01:23:41 --> 01:23:43] This is a grown man, right?
[01:23:43 --> 01:23:44] He has to grow, man.
[01:23:46 --> 01:23:57] That would be like sampled in the next Kanye song or something.
[01:23:57 --> 01:23:59] Yeah, we can leave it there.
[01:23:59 --> 01:24:01] We don't have to play anymore, but it's so haunting.
[01:24:01 --> 01:24:02] It's so haunting.
[01:24:02 --> 01:24:07] First of all, what fucking psycho figured out that if you cut off little boys' balls,
[01:24:07 --> 01:24:09] you could make them sing like that forever?
[01:24:09 --> 01:24:12] Like what fucking psycho was the first person to do that?
[01:24:12 --> 01:24:13] Yeah.
[01:24:13 --> 01:24:14] Cause these are little kids they're doing it to it.
[01:24:14 --> 01:24:16] They're doing it like six year olds.
[01:24:16 --> 01:24:17] Is this in the shirt?
[01:24:17 --> 01:24:18] Was this like a church thing or...
[01:24:18 --> 01:24:19] I do not know.
[01:24:19 --> 01:24:20] It was an opera thing.
[01:24:20 --> 01:24:22] But I know opera thing.
[01:24:22 --> 01:24:28] Castrating men, you know, UNIX was a common thing when people were working in the homes
[01:24:28 --> 01:24:30] of Royals, they'd castrate them.
[01:24:30 --> 01:24:34] There's one of the most horrific stories was Nero.
[01:24:34 --> 01:24:42] Nero beat his wife to death and then took a slave boy who looked like his wife and castrated
[01:24:42 --> 01:24:43] him.
[01:24:43 --> 01:24:47] He changed his name to his wife and presented him as his wife.
[01:24:47 --> 01:24:48] Yeah.
[01:24:48 --> 01:24:53] People in power have always been horrible.
[01:24:53 --> 01:24:56] People when they get unchecked power have always been horrible.
[01:24:56 --> 01:25:01] That's why directionally like this whole no kings protest that's supposed to go down
[01:25:01 --> 01:25:04] on Saturday, directionally it's correct.
[01:25:04 --> 01:25:08] Like you don't want kings, you don't want all of ours, but who's funding it?
[01:25:08 --> 01:25:10] Which turns out it's funded by an all of a dark.
[01:25:10 --> 01:25:16] It's their funded by a lady worth $20 billion, who is the ares to Walmart, who Walmart
[01:25:16 --> 01:25:20] a company that employs cheap labor and sells a lot of stuff from China that'd be affected
[01:25:20 --> 01:25:21] by tariffs.
[01:25:21 --> 01:25:25] You know, it's like that with all of them though, it's like it's like that with everything
[01:25:25 --> 01:25:26] man.
[01:25:26 --> 01:25:31] Everything is like it presents as being this moral situation, like you're really looking
[01:25:31 --> 01:25:32] out for you.
[01:25:32 --> 01:25:37] Really looking out for people, they're never really looking out for people.
[01:25:37 --> 01:25:43] There's always some primary profit motive that's causing any organized thing.
[01:25:43 --> 01:25:48] It's never for the human race, it's not unless the people are all on mushrooms.
[01:25:48 --> 01:25:52] It's never for the human race and until mushrooms get legalized, it's probably never
[01:25:52 --> 01:25:55] going to happen and that's the real battle.
[01:25:55 --> 01:25:59] The real battle is what gets legal first, AI or mushrooms.
[01:25:59 --> 01:26:00] You know?
[01:26:00 --> 01:26:05] Both of us will lead towards God, both of them will lead towards God, but one with a completely
[01:26:05 --> 01:26:06] different outcome.
[01:26:06 --> 01:26:10] It's going to take me like four or five times listening to it to be able to talk about
[01:26:10 --> 01:26:15] it, but I've went back and listened to the maps of meaning on audible and it's one
[01:26:15 --> 01:26:19] of Jordan's earlier works, you know, when he's talking about society and how it's structured
[01:26:19 --> 01:26:24] and basically talks about like the motivations and the origins of why people always resort
[01:26:24 --> 01:26:25] to evil.
[01:26:25 --> 01:26:29] You know, I mean, we talk so much about the Holocaust, but not at all about all the other
[01:26:29 --> 01:26:30] horrible tragedies.
[01:26:30 --> 01:26:32] They happen there at the same time, but even like talking about with Russia, like just
[01:26:32 --> 01:26:36] think about the Soviet Union and what happened there and how easily people were turned
[01:26:36 --> 01:26:37] again.
[01:26:37 --> 01:26:42] It's just we at this little moment in time or in it's just so we should just be so thankful
[01:26:42 --> 01:26:43] for it.
[01:26:43 --> 01:26:46] Even though it is mass chaos right now, like the fact that we can, the fact that people
[01:26:46 --> 01:26:50] are allowed to speak freely and do things and have had the influence and power they do
[01:26:50 --> 01:26:54] it's just nuts when you think about you're right, I mean, it's the the same crazy people
[01:26:54 --> 01:26:58] that we're arguing about today have always existed in different forms and with different
[01:26:58 --> 01:26:59] names and faces.
[01:26:59 --> 01:27:04] But we are better off today than anybody else in human history and this is a struggle
[01:27:04 --> 01:27:08] and it is a battle, but I think we can come out of this on the other side.
[01:27:08 --> 01:27:12] We all realize that we would be in play against each other and that's worth important.
[01:27:12 --> 01:27:16] You know, when you're paying people to protest, you're leaving palettes of bricks around
[01:27:16 --> 01:27:20] and you're organizing the whole thing and you're shipping people in on buses and you're
[01:27:20 --> 01:27:23] making sure that all the people show up at a certain amount of time and they're all compensated
[01:27:23 --> 01:27:28] and you get in water and snacks, like we got to realize what's going on here.
[01:27:28 --> 01:27:29] This is not for you.
[01:27:29 --> 01:27:32] When you light your city on fire and you burn cop cars, it's never good, it's not good
[01:27:32 --> 01:27:35] for you, it's not good for the cause, it's not going to change the laws.
[01:27:35 --> 01:27:41] One thing that I heard from Trump today that I thought was very promising is that he wants
[01:27:41 --> 01:27:46] to make an executive order where people that are here for a long time that have been
[01:27:46 --> 01:27:51] like working on farms that are undocumented, that they won't be targeted and that they'll
[01:27:51 --> 01:27:53] be exempt from all this stuff.
[01:27:53 --> 01:27:59] This is my feeling, like if you got here and you've integrated into our society,
[01:27:59 --> 01:28:02] yeah, maybe you shouldn't have snuck in, but you did it and you're not breaking any laws,
[01:28:02 --> 01:28:06] you're a hardworking person, those people need a path to citizenship, man.
[01:28:06 --> 01:28:11] Because if you don't, then they're just pred upon by people that will take advantage
[01:28:11 --> 01:28:14] of the fact that they're undocumented and not paying what they're legally supposed to
[01:28:14 --> 01:28:18] pay them and not giving benefits if they're legally supposed to have benefits and they
[01:28:18 --> 01:28:21] can't say anything because they're worried that immigration is going to get called
[01:28:21 --> 01:28:22] on them.
[01:28:22 --> 01:28:26] People are in this constant state of anxiety, and then they hear about the ice rates,
[01:28:26 --> 01:28:29] like at home deep-o, like what the fuck is that?
[01:28:29 --> 01:28:34] There was a big ice rate at the Facebook data center job, not far from my place, where
[01:28:34 --> 01:28:36] I used to go and watch it.
[01:28:36 --> 01:28:38] Facebook data center ice rate?
[01:28:38 --> 01:28:43] Yeah, the Facebook project, it's not far from me in Virginia, I think it's technically
[01:28:43 --> 01:28:47] would be in South Boston, I think it's technically in South Boston.
[01:28:47 --> 01:28:50] Ice date is, Facebook didn't bribe ice.
[01:28:50 --> 01:28:51] There's a Facebook.
[01:28:51 --> 01:28:58] There's a big job that I used to have to go on some that's in the Southern part of Virginia,
[01:28:58 --> 01:29:02] like not far from North Carolina, and somebody was sending me pictures there from the other
[01:29:02 --> 01:29:06] day, but they had a big ice rate, and they were running through the, like, people were
[01:29:06 --> 01:29:10] just escaping the job, like running away from the job and stuff as well.
[01:29:10 --> 01:29:11] Why?
[01:29:11 --> 01:29:12] Why?
[01:29:12 --> 01:29:14] Like gang members, yes, criminals, yes.
[01:29:14 --> 01:29:15] This why?
[01:29:15 --> 01:29:16] Why?
[01:29:16 --> 01:29:22] Like, I think as crazy as it sounds, the only way to do this and look like you have
[01:29:22 --> 01:29:28] a heart is evaluate people on a case by case basis, like this is good people.
[01:29:28 --> 01:29:29] It's good people.
[01:29:29 --> 01:29:32] It's also so complicated because it goes back for so long, and the idea, the thing
[01:29:32 --> 01:29:36] now is that there's two very polarizing opinions of what America even is, a represents
[01:29:36 --> 01:29:40] or what job it's supposed to serve to the world, so like, you know, and some, yeah,
[01:29:40 --> 01:29:45] sure, like, for any country to exist, it has to have, there has to be something there
[01:29:45 --> 01:29:49] that identifies what it is as a country, and you have, and like there's, like, yeah,
[01:29:49 --> 01:29:54] it just seems like without citizenship or without some definitive thing, if who's a citizen
[01:29:54 --> 01:29:58] or not, it's like, then it's not even a country, it's like, and most every country has
[01:29:58 --> 01:29:59] some, like, the idea of their, no, no, no, no.
[01:30:00 --> 01:30:03] no immigration laws for a country means that it's no longer a country, but I also think it's
[01:30:03 --> 01:30:11] like, the opposite side of that, too, is like America has always, in theory even though it's
[01:30:11 --> 01:30:16] always been ran by these, there's always been these corrupt people involved in it. In theory,
[01:30:16 --> 01:30:20] you know, America was started as sort of this thing that was like, that can maybe be like,
[01:30:22 --> 01:30:28] like a sanctuary that like, that doesn't allow the, doesn't allow monarchies and dictators
[01:30:28 --> 01:30:34] and horrible things, you know, like, as bad as America, maybe has been in certain cases like
[01:30:34 --> 01:30:40] the fact that when Japan laws, they didn't just go and take it over and call it another part of
[01:30:40 --> 01:30:45] America, like they went and tried to rebuild, like, in theory, America's supposed to be this
[01:30:45 --> 01:30:50] vein that exists of, you know, it's, it's, it's originate, it's origination is from people who
[01:30:50 --> 01:30:54] wanted to get away from monarchies and dictators and, of course, like, it's so easy to pick on the
[01:30:54 --> 01:30:58] founding fathers and all their faults and the crazy things they did, but it was centuries ago,
[01:30:58 --> 01:31:02] in a different culture and they probably were all maniacs. He'd have to be a maniac to,
[01:31:02 --> 01:31:07] to go up against the world's biggest empire and take it on, you know, like, musk it with a
[01:31:07 --> 01:31:12] fucking, yeah, like, you'd have to be crazy and, of course, they had personality flaws, but they
[01:31:12 --> 01:31:16] were, the reality is is that, here's the thing that sucks is like, and it goes both ways,
[01:31:16 --> 01:31:20] there's a lot of things about people on the left that people on the right don't realize
[01:31:20 --> 01:31:24] that they haven't come and it's the same way with this, like, I, it breaks my heart when people
[01:31:24 --> 01:31:28] just totally trash the founding fathers, not because they were these morally, they took
[01:31:28 --> 01:31:32] horrendous shits too, I'm sure, probably not as bad as Beyonce, but pretty close. And, you know,
[01:31:32 --> 01:31:36] the fact, like, of course they were bad people, they were all bad, we're humans, we're flawed,
[01:31:36 --> 01:31:40] inherently, even the best of us, even the ones who act like, we're the best and the most,
[01:31:40 --> 01:31:43] like, we're all screwed up, we all have our problems and our faults and stuff, but the fact
[01:31:43 --> 01:31:48] that they were willing to, like, go somewhere to another land with all these, with all this crazy
[01:31:48 --> 01:31:53] stuff and then take on the, you know, the world's biggest empire at that time, just so they could
[01:31:53 --> 01:31:57] be able to do what they, you know, religious freedom, it's like, they didn't want really just
[01:31:57 --> 01:32:01] freedom because they were not even necessarily because they wanted to go to church. I always thought
[01:32:01 --> 01:32:05] it was like, it's so weird that they, they were fighting for religion, but it wasn't that they were
[01:32:05 --> 01:32:09] fighting for religion, they were fighting for the mandate of religion for the, they were, they were
[01:32:09 --> 01:32:14] tired of the church and like, I know it's not considered the church anymore, but there is still
[01:32:14 --> 01:32:19] a church that dominates us and tries to control us now and that now, unfortunately now the church
[01:32:19 --> 01:32:24] is just sort of this weird thing, but it's the, it's a zebra mentality, you know, among politicians,
[01:32:24 --> 01:32:28] it's like it goes back to that, I think it's Jordan Peterson that talks about the zebras and how
[01:32:28 --> 01:32:31] they'll do a study on zebras and they'll, it's in the maps of meaning book, I believe, and they'll
[01:32:31 --> 01:32:37] mark one red to study it and then the predators take that zebra down because the zebra is stripes,
[01:32:37 --> 01:32:41] aren't camouflage to their surroundings, they're camouflage to each other so they're not easily
[01:32:41 --> 01:32:45] identifyable. And so four, five lions can't take one zebra down if they all look the same.
[01:32:45 --> 01:32:49] And in politics, I believe that's what's happened, especially on the left, you know,
[01:32:50 --> 01:32:55] I had people in Nashville quit working with me because I, I talked about this when I was at the
[01:32:55 --> 01:33:02] rhyming, but we had this, this, this, this dancing, this chick that plays the fiddle and she does
[01:33:02 --> 01:33:06] like flat dancing and stuff named Hilary Klug, who lives in Nashville and we had her come to the
[01:33:06 --> 01:33:11] rhyming to do this show with us and it was on a last minute thing and I'm about to introduce her
[01:33:11 --> 01:33:16] and I tell the crowd, I'm like, hey, you know, I said, I got Hilary about to come out and I was like,
[01:33:16 --> 01:33:21] but it's not, don't worry, it's not that Hilary and just made it all tough. Just made a joke about it.
[01:33:21 --> 01:33:25] Well, I just, somebody said something in the crowd that was, and I don't know, I just interact,
[01:33:25 --> 01:33:28] and I just say what comes among, I don't care, you know, I don't worry about all that stuff
[01:33:28 --> 01:33:32] and what people might think, I just try to say what I feel. But I was like, you know, isn't
[01:33:32 --> 01:33:36] it crazy that somebody like Hilary who not that long ago, I can remember vividly and as a
[01:33:36 --> 01:33:41] child or an teenage years, like being completely against the idea of even having two people of the
[01:33:41 --> 01:33:48] same gender be married. Like she was as against gay marriage is like any, any person on the far
[01:33:48 --> 01:33:52] right is now, you know, and that was, that was, that was in my childhood early, and I said, and now
[01:33:52 --> 01:33:56] the fact that now that it's okay for kids to become transgender and go through like what Michael did,
[01:33:57 --> 01:34:01] that's to me is just it just shows that it's all theatrics and that none of those people really
[01:34:01 --> 01:34:06] have any real like opinions about any of the stuff. It's all about what will sell, you know, like
[01:34:06 --> 01:34:12] did you say this at the rhyme? I said this at the rhyme and so I had my, I had my management company
[01:34:12 --> 01:34:15] that I was using and then dropped me and a bunch of other people without even telling me they
[01:34:15 --> 01:34:19] just emailed my attorney and said they couldn't work with me anymore. They were that mad about that,
[01:34:20 --> 01:34:25] which tells you how far off the deep end, but anyway, it's just, well everything you're saying
[01:34:25 --> 01:34:31] is just, but you're exactly, you're exactly right with all that. It's just it's difficult to
[01:34:31 --> 01:34:35] convey that to people because there's so many emotions involved, but at the end of the day it's like
[01:34:36 --> 01:34:40] I don't see a whole lot of difference and people on the left and the right anymore. I think we're all
[01:34:40 --> 01:34:46] just like, like you said, we all, we all are trying to just effectively accomplish the same thing,
[01:34:46 --> 01:34:51] just in different ways and it's really easy to get angry at somebody that's on the same level as you
[01:34:51 --> 01:34:54] than somebody that you don't even know exists, which is like what these private equity companies
[01:34:54 --> 01:35:00] and these people in the background that do all, like the, the enemy that, so what's happened is
[01:35:00 --> 01:35:04] is going back to the zebra thing when I think it's happened, it's like especially in politics,
[01:35:04 --> 01:35:09] the reason why Hillary Clinton can be against gay marriage and then four transgender kids in
[01:35:09 --> 01:35:13] a very short period of my lifetime and a whole bunch of other politicians, whether,
[01:35:13 --> 01:35:17] is that they're all just constantly rearranging their stripes, so all the zebras look just alike,
[01:35:17 --> 01:35:22] because as soon as one of them looks a little bit different, you know, like a, it's a great
[01:35:22 --> 01:35:27] like Tulsi Gabbard or whatever, I don't know, there's plenty of people besides that's just the
[01:35:27 --> 01:35:33] first one that comes to mind that's like, you know, trying to be a Democrat and, and upholding
[01:35:33 --> 01:35:37] most of what the Democratic Party would have wanted her to uphold up until very recently,
[01:35:37 --> 01:35:40] but because she didn't rearrange her stripes, it's like, you're dead, but there's a whole
[01:35:40 --> 01:35:46] bunch of more, like her, too, that, that aren't even in politics anymore, but that's, that's the
[01:35:46 --> 01:35:50] way I see it now, is it's like all these people, and so like, even with Big Donny, you know,
[01:35:50 --> 01:35:57] I wonder, like, yeah, I see, I just wonder, even, I just don't trust, it's kind of my Alex
[01:35:57 --> 01:36:01] Jones syndrome, but it's like, no matter how cool somebody seems like that, I think like, man,
[01:36:01 --> 01:36:06] it's, it's him and Hillary really still chit, like, they're probably smoking a fat joint right now,
[01:36:06 --> 01:36:09] this laugh, I don't know, like, you just don't really know, you don't really know, you're just,
[01:36:10 --> 01:36:14] you have to see what you see, and you have to take it in and just hope that you have that somehow
[01:36:14 --> 01:36:18] you have the discernment to know what's true or not, but you really just don't, I mean, even with me,
[01:36:18 --> 01:36:24] man, so much crazy stuff that gets said and done, and I just don't even, when things come out
[01:36:24 --> 01:36:27] about me, then aren't true, I just don't even reply or acknowledge him anymore, I just let him
[01:36:27 --> 01:36:31] exist and their own little space and be part of it, and I've just decided that, again, we're
[01:36:31 --> 01:36:36] just all, we're just in this crazy thing, we're all this stuff happens and it's just, I don't know,
[01:36:36 --> 01:36:41] you can't, the problem is so many people that don't do that, they're not aware of how much influence
[01:36:41 --> 01:36:47] is being peddled onto them, how much, how much their mind, their opinion is being affected by this
[01:36:47 --> 01:36:52] nonsense, on social media, by bots and by all these different things. What you said about the
[01:36:52 --> 01:36:57] zebras and the stripes, so fucking perfect, one of my favorite clips is Hillary Clinton when
[01:36:57 --> 01:37:06] she was running, I think it was 2012, it might have been, when did she, he first became president,
[01:37:06 --> 01:37:14] 2008, right? Obama, it might have been 2008, but she was running and she was more
[01:37:14 --> 01:37:19] MAGA than MAGA, she was talking about the border and about people coming over here, if you want to
[01:37:19 --> 01:37:24] stay, you get a stiff fine, and if you've done anything illegal, you get exported, no questions
[01:37:24 --> 01:37:31] asked, and listen to this, give me this full volume from the beginning, wait till you hear this,
[01:37:31 --> 01:37:38] this is wild. So I think we got to have tough conditions, tell people to come out of the shadows,
[01:37:38 --> 01:37:46] if they've committed a crime, deport them, no questions asked, they're gone. If they, if they've been
[01:37:46 --> 01:37:51] working, and are law abiding, we should say here are the conditions for you staying, you have to
[01:37:51 --> 01:37:57] pay a stiff fine because you came here illegally, you have to pay back taxes, and you have to try to
[01:37:57 --> 01:38:04] learn English, and you have to wait in line. It's like, you have to wait and look, that's so MAGA.
[01:38:05 --> 01:38:10] I mean, but this proves the point that none of that really means they're sitting in the green room
[01:38:10 --> 01:38:14] in the back before that speech, and there's like some stuff for it now, and they're just like,
[01:38:14 --> 01:38:18] oh, I got to try to remember all this crap, like none of that meant anything, you know,
[01:38:18 --> 01:38:21] like none of that, I don't think she even believed when she said it back then, and other of it,
[01:38:21 --> 01:38:26] she thought it was what the country wanted to hear. That's all it is. It's all focus group shit.
[01:38:26 --> 01:38:31] It's all what the country wants to hear, and what the party agrees upon, what the zebras all agree on.
[01:38:31 --> 01:38:36] When you just said that, that's it perfectly, and as it morphs, as it gets into trans kids,
[01:38:36 --> 01:38:40] you got to support trans people in the military, whatever it is, they just all fucking hop in line,
[01:38:40 --> 01:38:45] what flag am I putting in my Twitter? And to go back to go back to what you said at the beginning
[01:38:45 --> 01:38:49] about those kids that are riding, and they don't really even know what they're riding,
[01:38:49 --> 01:38:53] they got the mask on, but they're doing this, and it's like, I guess what I mean is,
[01:38:53 --> 01:39:00] there's a bunch of human beings on Earth, especially now, like in this sort of like American
[01:39:00 --> 01:39:04] culture and all the other sub-series of it, like in Europe and everywhere, so Americanized now,
[01:39:04 --> 01:39:08] but there's all these people who are really angry. It's kind of like, it's the reason why
[01:39:09 --> 01:39:13] you know, there's so many of these videos where they interview like the antifa dudes,
[01:39:13 --> 01:39:17] and they don't really even know why they're not able to talk, they're not really able to articulate
[01:39:17 --> 01:39:20] why they're there, what they believe, they're just there because they want to, they're just there to riot,
[01:39:20 --> 01:39:27] you know, there's this like general anger that I think has dwells in a lot of us towards the
[01:39:27 --> 01:39:32] system that we realize is inefficient and ineffective and rigged, but it's just too complex, at least
[01:39:32 --> 01:39:36] individually, and through the means of the internet for us to identify who our enemies really are,
[01:39:37 --> 01:39:42] and so instead it's like, let's just go, let's just go, let's go catch some shit on fire,
[01:39:42 --> 01:39:45] because at least it feels like we're doing something, even though, but I think like,
[01:39:46 --> 01:39:53] I think there's a lot more in common between the patriotic cosplaying type people who want to,
[01:39:53 --> 01:39:59] who talk all the time about like, you know, that and the people who are like antifa, I actually think
[01:40:00 --> 01:40:01] with the same cloth.
[01:40:01 --> 01:40:04] They just both just don't really realize it.
[01:40:04 --> 01:40:10] But I think like, there is this really amazing sort
[01:40:10 --> 01:40:13] of rebellious spirit of the left that just needs
[01:40:13 --> 01:40:15] to be reintegrated in a society with the right.
[01:40:15 --> 01:40:17] And then it becomes unstoppable.
[01:40:17 --> 01:40:19] And it no longer becomes a left and a right thing.
[01:40:19 --> 01:40:22] But I just don't think, like I give you another great example,
[01:40:22 --> 01:40:28] like when I was younger, I'd go to these some of these
[01:40:28 --> 01:40:29] protests in DC and stuff.
[01:40:29 --> 01:40:31] And I would always stay George Washington University
[01:40:31 --> 01:40:32] with these kids.
[01:40:32 --> 01:40:36] And we were all in our early 20s, probably.
[01:40:36 --> 01:40:39] And we're all very like, at that point,
[01:40:39 --> 01:40:41] there wasn't any like, real political identity to it.
[01:40:41 --> 01:40:43] I don't think those people would have called themselves
[01:40:43 --> 01:40:44] a left back then.
[01:40:44 --> 01:40:46] But you better believe most of them ended up going
[01:40:46 --> 01:40:48] to all the black block and the antifa and the black
[01:40:48 --> 01:40:49] blocks matter.
[01:40:49 --> 01:40:51] And every other protest there was just because they wanted
[01:40:51 --> 01:40:51] to go protest.
[01:40:51 --> 01:40:57] They just are like, it's like, yeah, it's a thing
[01:40:57 --> 01:41:01] of like rebelling against the system.
[01:41:01 --> 01:41:04] It doesn't really matter what part of the system it is
[01:41:04 --> 01:41:06] or if it really even makes any sense, you just know
[01:41:06 --> 01:41:10] that that's, yeah, it's like, I think that's what I mean,
[01:41:10 --> 01:41:11] it's the means of the internet.
[01:41:11 --> 01:41:13] I don't think we'll ever be able to organize all those people
[01:41:13 --> 01:41:15] together in a way that's productive.
[01:41:15 --> 01:41:16] But I do think in real life we can.
[01:41:16 --> 01:41:20] I do think, I do think through, I think music is,
[01:41:20 --> 01:41:22] I think that's why I want to focus mostly on music
[01:41:22 --> 01:41:24] and like trying to influence in and away to where the rich
[01:41:24 --> 01:41:25] don't control it.
[01:41:25 --> 01:41:28] And the rich don't choose what songs we listen to,
[01:41:28 --> 01:41:30] what songs make it on the charts, like we do.
[01:41:30 --> 01:41:31] I think that's the first step.
[01:41:31 --> 01:41:34] I think I actually think music is like, I guarantee you,
[01:41:34 --> 01:41:35] if you look, if there was some way to,
[01:41:35 --> 01:41:38] I'm sure there's some report to be ran where you could see
[01:41:38 --> 01:41:40] how people voted versus what kind of music people listen to.
[01:41:40 --> 01:41:42] And I guarantee you a lot of people who voted differently
[01:41:42 --> 01:41:45] listen to the same exact lyrics and resonate with them.
[01:41:45 --> 01:41:48] Like what is that, like there, that's all I mean.
[01:41:48 --> 01:41:51] Is this, we're just been, we've just been mass distracted
[01:41:51 --> 01:41:53] and miss, and misled, is all like.
[01:41:53 --> 01:41:55] Well, also when you get these kind of organized protests,
[01:41:55 --> 01:41:58] they're all organized with this one thought in mind.
[01:41:58 --> 01:42:04] Like there's unlawful changes in policies
[01:42:04 --> 01:42:07] that's shipping our community back to Mexico.
[01:42:07 --> 01:42:08] And we got to stop this.
[01:42:08 --> 01:42:11] These are all, you know, oligarchs are involved
[01:42:11 --> 01:42:15] and this is a dictatorship and they feel like they're fighting
[01:42:15 --> 01:42:16] against something bad.
[01:42:16 --> 01:42:18] And if they're unenformed and who the fuck
[01:42:18 --> 01:42:21] who's 21 is informed, you know?
[01:42:21 --> 01:42:24] Most people who are young, especially if you're going to college,
[01:42:24 --> 01:42:27] you're around a bunch of other like-minded people
[01:42:27 --> 01:42:29] in an echo chamber and you're all trying
[01:42:29 --> 01:42:33] to like get social credit by being the most woke
[01:42:33 --> 01:42:36] and the most activist, and you're the person who's the most involved,
[01:42:36 --> 01:42:37] and you're helping to organize,
[01:42:37 --> 01:42:39] and you feel like you get a sense of purpose.
[01:42:39 --> 01:42:42] And then there's also the thing of being on the ground
[01:42:42 --> 01:42:44] with a bunch of other people that are moving in a certain direction.
[01:42:44 --> 01:42:48] To me, it, I think it ignites a thing.
[01:42:48 --> 01:42:51] I think there's things inside of us that get ignited.
[01:42:51 --> 01:42:54] And one of them is like, here's the best way to describe
[01:42:54 --> 01:42:55] is like fishing.
[01:42:55 --> 01:42:57] You know when you go fishing,
[01:42:57 --> 01:42:59] I've seen people catch their first fish.
[01:42:59 --> 01:43:02] When that fish gets online, they're cool.
[01:43:02 --> 01:43:04] You get excited, everybody gets excited
[01:43:04 --> 01:43:07] because it's this ancient thing inside of you
[01:43:07 --> 01:43:09] that lets you know you're now successful.
[01:43:09 --> 01:43:12] Your family's going to eat, you caught a fish.
[01:43:12 --> 01:43:14] And it just like sparks it inside of you.
[01:43:14 --> 01:43:15] It does it with bow hunting,
[01:43:15 --> 01:43:18] but for every few people are going to go bow hunting.
[01:43:18 --> 01:43:20] But the other thing that does it with his war
[01:43:20 --> 01:43:22] and protests are like war.
[01:43:22 --> 01:43:24] You're marching, you're all together.
[01:43:24 --> 01:43:25] Who's opposing us?
[01:43:25 --> 01:43:26] Fuck them.
[01:43:26 --> 01:43:27] And you're everyone's all aggressive
[01:43:27 --> 01:43:28] and they're all chanting.
[01:43:28 --> 01:43:33] Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[01:43:33 --> 01:43:35] And you think you're doing the right thing.
[01:43:35 --> 01:43:37] You think you're doing the right thing.
[01:43:37 --> 01:43:38] And then you see shit like cops,
[01:43:38 --> 01:43:40] shoot and rubber bullets at reporters.
[01:43:40 --> 01:43:41] And you're like, what the fuck?
[01:43:41 --> 01:43:43] These people are garbage.
[01:43:43 --> 01:43:44] Like how you shoot and a reporter.
[01:43:44 --> 01:43:46] That's not what you're supposed to shoot with them.
[01:43:46 --> 01:43:49] Yeah, but I think the problem now is that it's
[01:43:49 --> 01:43:53] it's too complicated to be able to dissect it and correct it.
[01:43:53 --> 01:43:56] That like, like with these ice protests, though,
[01:43:56 --> 01:43:59] in other words, there's been such a heavily disputed
[01:43:59 --> 01:44:02] and mismanaged protocol of our immigration
[01:44:02 --> 01:44:03] in my entire life.
[01:44:03 --> 01:44:06] So now it's like, you can't now just go in
[01:44:06 --> 01:44:08] and just try to, like that's what's going to happen.
[01:44:08 --> 01:44:09] People are going to protest though
[01:44:09 --> 01:44:10] and you just all of a sudden go in
[01:44:10 --> 01:44:13] and try to just like clean house all it wants.
[01:44:13 --> 01:44:15] It's like we've never even really established
[01:44:15 --> 01:44:18] as a country what it is or because like,
[01:44:18 --> 01:44:20] because most of the people we've listened to
[01:44:20 --> 01:44:22] the last 20 years will say stuff like that
[01:44:22 --> 01:44:24] and whatever year that was 2008
[01:44:24 --> 01:44:27] and now say, gosh, can you imagine if somebody said that now?
[01:44:27 --> 01:44:30] That they would be like, they would be a racist
[01:44:30 --> 01:44:32] and taken off the internet for saying what Hillary said
[01:44:32 --> 01:44:34] on their behalf and to speak English and stuff.
[01:44:34 --> 01:44:35] So it's for sure.
[01:44:35 --> 01:44:37] But there's a big difference in protests
[01:44:37 --> 01:44:39] and organized protests where you're paying people
[01:44:39 --> 01:44:41] and then you're leaving bricks around.
[01:44:41 --> 01:44:44] This is like, it's a bastardization.
[01:44:44 --> 01:44:46] It's a, they've taken over the thing.
[01:44:46 --> 01:44:48] This, the, the virtue of this thing,
[01:44:48 --> 01:44:50] like this part of the first amendment,
[01:44:50 --> 01:44:51] you're right to express yourself.
[01:44:51 --> 01:44:53] The right for the people to get together
[01:44:53 --> 01:44:55] and say, hey, this is not cool
[01:44:55 --> 01:44:58] and they've distorted it with money, like everything else.
[01:44:58 --> 01:45:01] Yeah, and they've used it as a political tool.
[01:45:01 --> 01:45:03] I would think maybe that's happened a lot though,
[01:45:03 --> 01:45:07] even in, in the past with like, civil rights and everything else.
[01:45:07 --> 01:45:10] A lot of that was much more organized than it was made.
[01:45:10 --> 01:45:12] Like I didn't know until just a couple years ago,
[01:45:12 --> 01:45:14] like I've learned the story all through school
[01:45:14 --> 01:45:17] and heard it a million times about Rosa Parks,
[01:45:17 --> 01:45:18] but I didn't realize until a couple years ago
[01:45:18 --> 01:45:21] that she was part of some, I don't know,
[01:45:21 --> 01:45:22] I don't even know what she was part of,
[01:45:22 --> 01:45:23] but she was part of some organization
[01:45:23 --> 01:45:26] and it was like a planned thing.
[01:45:26 --> 01:45:30] I just, I was always taught it like she just spontaneously did it.
[01:45:30 --> 01:45:32] But I think, I think there's just,
[01:45:32 --> 01:45:35] there's every, every like thing in history
[01:45:35 --> 01:45:37] has this whole backstory to it that we don't really know
[01:45:37 --> 01:45:38] much about.
[01:45:38 --> 01:45:40] Most things have been manipulated if they can be manipulated.
[01:45:40 --> 01:45:42] Once they realize they can manipulate people,
[01:45:42 --> 01:45:46] they started, and they probably started that a long time ago.
[01:45:46 --> 01:45:48] I mean, we've talked about it a million times,
[01:45:48 --> 01:45:51] so that's why Smedley Butler, World War, World War is a racket.
[01:45:51 --> 01:45:55] In 1933, you know, Major General Smedley Butler,
[01:45:55 --> 01:45:57] who was, they, they tried to get him
[01:45:57 --> 01:45:59] to overthrow the fucking government with the coup
[01:45:59 --> 01:46:01] and he wouldn't do it and then he writes his book
[01:46:01 --> 01:46:05] about how every single operation he was involved with.
[01:46:05 --> 01:46:06] He thought they were doing this,
[01:46:06 --> 01:46:08] but really they were just making it safe for bankers.
[01:46:08 --> 01:46:10] They're really just overthrowing a government
[01:46:10 --> 01:46:11] and stalling a friendly one.
[01:46:11 --> 01:46:15] It's like it's been going on since they could.
[01:46:15 --> 01:46:17] And back then, it was way easier to pull off
[01:46:17 --> 01:46:18] because there was no internet.
[01:46:18 --> 01:46:20] We could pull up a Hillary Clinton video
[01:46:20 --> 01:46:23] from more than a decade ago and go, look at her.
[01:46:23 --> 01:46:25] She's a pretty maga.
[01:46:25 --> 01:46:27] You could put a fucking red hat on that lady
[01:46:27 --> 01:46:32] and she'd be standing on that stage right next to RFK Junior, you know?
[01:46:32 --> 01:46:34] Yeah, and it's just,
[01:46:34 --> 01:46:36] because there's such an information never loads stuff like that
[01:46:36 --> 01:46:38] will always be forgotten about too soon,
[01:46:38 --> 01:46:39] too for it to make a difference.
[01:46:40 --> 01:46:43] She could have been Trump's vice president back then.
[01:46:43 --> 01:46:44] Yeah.
[01:46:44 --> 01:46:45] Like no bullshit.
[01:46:45 --> 01:46:48] She would have been like queen mom of Trump land.
[01:46:48 --> 01:46:51] They would be people with Hillary Clinton flags
[01:46:51 --> 01:46:54] flying behind their pickup trucks with her
[01:46:54 --> 01:46:56] with like two fists in the air with a maga hat on.
[01:46:56 --> 01:46:57] I'm not bullshit.
[01:46:57 --> 01:47:00] But I remember even back then, like, well, you know,
[01:47:00 --> 01:47:02] the one, that's what made me fall in love with comedy
[01:47:02 --> 01:47:04] was Norm McDonald and like his whole bit
[01:47:04 --> 01:47:07] about the Clinton's and stuff and getting on the view
[01:47:07 --> 01:47:09] and frying all them up and stuff.
[01:47:09 --> 01:47:12] But even back then, I remember they were trying to,
[01:47:12 --> 01:47:14] like, I guess he got kicked off a Saturday night live
[01:47:14 --> 01:47:15] because of that, right?
[01:47:15 --> 01:47:16] And all was it, because of the Clinton's,
[01:47:16 --> 01:47:18] or it might have been because of his product
[01:47:18 --> 01:47:19] because he's too funny.
[01:47:19 --> 01:47:20] There was something else.
[01:47:20 --> 01:47:25] Yeah, but there's Adam.
[01:47:25 --> 01:47:27] Yeah, there was one of the funniest people of all time
[01:47:27 --> 01:47:30] and his weekend update that thing that he would do
[01:47:30 --> 01:47:31] was fucking fantastic.
[01:47:31 --> 01:47:33] His franta, he was the best ever at it.
[01:47:33 --> 01:47:34] He was so good.
[01:47:34 --> 01:47:38] And the jokes were so, he would go so out there.
[01:47:38 --> 01:47:40] Back when you could, you know?
[01:47:40 --> 01:47:42] And if that's what got him kicked off a Saturday night live,
[01:47:42 --> 01:47:45] great, makes him even more of a legend.
[01:47:45 --> 01:47:46] I think more.
[01:47:46 --> 01:47:49] Yeah, I think that's what's important about,
[01:47:49 --> 01:47:52] I'm not a fan of all the real crazy,
[01:47:52 --> 01:47:54] vulgar humor sometimes and stuff.
[01:47:54 --> 01:47:56] Like, I'm more of a norm type of comedy guy.
[01:47:56 --> 01:47:58] Like, I like the more goofy stuff
[01:47:58 --> 01:48:00] that's not like constantly talking about
[01:48:00 --> 01:48:02] penises and stuff, but like, you know,
[01:48:02 --> 01:48:04] or whatever, like, whatever it is,
[01:48:04 --> 01:48:06] say, and everything else, but it's really important
[01:48:06 --> 01:48:08] that all that stuff does exist
[01:48:08 --> 01:48:10] just because of the idea, if I think it's important
[01:48:10 --> 01:48:12] that there's this place that exists here
[01:48:12 --> 01:48:14] and Austin that freedom of speech will always be.
[01:48:14 --> 01:48:18] And even if, you know, it's like it's such a critical thing,
[01:48:18 --> 01:48:19] especially now more than ever.
[01:48:19 --> 01:48:21] I think critical for everybody, even if you don't agree
[01:48:21 --> 01:48:24] with it, and that's so hard for people to recognize.
[01:48:24 --> 01:48:26] When people don't have a voice and someone has a voice
[01:48:26 --> 01:48:28] and that voice is different than their opinion,
[01:48:28 --> 01:48:31] they want to shut it down, they want to silence it.
[01:48:31 --> 01:48:34] And they want to elevate their voice nature,
[01:48:34 --> 01:48:39] just pure natural instincts that human beings have.
[01:48:39 --> 01:48:41] And you've got to resist that because you've got to realize
[01:48:41 --> 01:48:43] you don't want that used on you, right?
[01:48:43 --> 01:48:45] Well, then don't use it on other people.
[01:48:45 --> 01:48:46] Yeah, well, everyone's guilty.
[01:48:46 --> 01:48:48] Like, I went, when I was at the ARC,
[01:48:48 --> 01:48:50] where we spoke of that thing in London,
[01:48:50 --> 01:48:53] there was a talk we went to, I think, the next night
[01:48:53 --> 01:48:55] that was about freedom of speech.
[01:48:55 --> 01:48:57] And I can't remember the, I can't remember
[01:48:57 --> 01:48:58] who all was speaking there.
[01:48:58 --> 01:49:00] It was some people that I should probably remember.
[01:49:00 --> 01:49:05] But yeah, but they were talking about, it was a group
[01:49:06 --> 01:49:08] that was defending people in Europe
[01:49:08 --> 01:49:10] that were like being arrested and stuff
[01:49:10 --> 01:49:12] for things they had reposted online,
[01:49:12 --> 01:49:15] which is really important, like they're arresting people
[01:49:15 --> 01:49:17] for political things that they put online in Europe
[01:49:17 --> 01:49:21] and like not even giving them very obscure reasoning
[01:49:21 --> 01:49:25] as to why in some cases they won't even tell them
[01:49:25 --> 01:49:26] what they're arresting them for.
[01:49:26 --> 01:49:28] And so like the cause of what these people are doing
[01:49:28 --> 01:49:29] is very important, but the whole time
[01:49:30 --> 01:49:32] they're referring to it as the woke mind virus,
[01:49:32 --> 01:49:34] which is yeah, sure, funny, put in a bid or whatever,
[01:49:34 --> 01:49:38] but God like, no, what it is is it's like the government
[01:49:38 --> 01:49:42] using this one specific thing out of a list of things
[01:49:42 --> 01:49:44] that they could as part of this moral high ground
[01:49:44 --> 01:49:46] to arrest people for speaking out against.
[01:49:46 --> 01:49:48] Not because it has nothing to do with anything
[01:49:48 --> 01:49:50] on the left of the rights, the fact that the state
[01:49:50 --> 01:49:52] would love for people to not be allowed
[01:49:52 --> 01:49:53] to criticize anything, because then that means
[01:49:53 --> 01:49:55] they can't criticize them.
[01:49:55 --> 01:49:55] 100%.
[01:49:55 --> 01:49:57] But by them saying woke mind virus,
[01:49:57 --> 01:49:59] every five minutes while they're talking about it,
[01:49:59 --> 01:50:00] it just in.
[01:50:00 --> 01:50:09] Immediately polarizes half the people who they need to get on board in order to stop it, which is the left to it's like, I don't know, there's just, I don't know, I think I might try to,
[01:50:09 --> 01:50:13] one of these days, I might just try to give the old thing a run and see it, but I really think I could.
[01:50:14 --> 01:50:21] It would be, it would probably be a run for press, it would probably be, it would probably end in like a nuclear war, but I think we could do,
[01:50:21 --> 01:50:27] I think it'd be pretty interesting, I think you're going to run for office, if you will fuck that, no,
[01:50:28 --> 01:50:31] I've no, I'm not on the same page, I don't know,
[01:50:31 --> 01:50:33] vermin supreme, call me up, no he's kidding,
[01:50:33 --> 01:50:39] I don't think I would, I might do like a governor run somewhere or something or a mayor, maybe I'll start with mayor, maybe that's a good one.
[01:50:39 --> 01:50:45] It's like a terrible job dude, don't do it, I would say don't do it, but if you have to do it, do it,
[01:50:45 --> 01:50:47] I mean, someone should do it that's like you.
[01:50:47 --> 01:50:54] I just remember in my whole life, like since I was a kid, people were like, man, what would happen if just we got some regular dude in there and like all this,
[01:50:54 --> 01:50:57] it's just like, I don't know, to get immediately disillusioned,
[01:50:57 --> 01:51:05] you'd realize the entanglements that exist, and I think it's impossible to navigate, I think once you get in there, you're like, holy shit.
[01:51:06 --> 01:51:10] And when I talk to people that are in this administration now that weren't before,
[01:51:10 --> 01:51:16] that realize like all the paperwork and red tape and bureaucracy and all the different departments,
[01:51:16 --> 01:51:22] all the people that are controlling these departments and all the fucking resistance you have to any change,
[01:51:22 --> 01:51:28] and all the people that don't want to give you the information that you're asking for, and it gets wild and exhausting.
[01:51:28 --> 01:51:34] And you're dealing with a machine that's been operating pretty much unchecked for decades.
[01:51:34 --> 01:51:36] Well, let's check them out, get me old check.
[01:51:36 --> 01:51:37] Look what they did to Elon.
[01:51:37 --> 01:51:38] He tried to check them out.
[01:51:38 --> 01:51:41] The chairman will not see, I mean, it's like,
[01:51:41 --> 01:51:43] well, do you think was there?
[01:51:43 --> 01:51:47] I'm not well right on any of this, this is like, this is actually something I wanted to ask you about,
[01:51:47 --> 01:51:51] at one point or another anyway, was your take on like the Elon Trump situation,
[01:51:51 --> 01:51:54] but, you know, I, um, apparently they're making up.
[01:51:54 --> 01:51:55] Do you think things are cool now?
[01:51:55 --> 01:51:58] The supposedly, you know, on conversation on the phone.
[01:51:58 --> 01:52:02] The argument, but the argument behind it was that they felt like Trump wasn't letting Elon,
[01:52:02 --> 01:52:04] see, I don't, I don't know what to think of.
[01:52:04 --> 01:52:09] I really don't know what to think of any of that situation or Elon in general, and I just say,
[01:52:09 --> 01:52:14] I just, it really fascinated me that it seemed like they were both using
[01:52:14 --> 01:52:18] doge for different reasons, maybe, or they had different motivations behind it.
[01:52:18 --> 01:52:24] But what if, what if it was like a genuine, what if there was genuine audits done on everything,
[01:52:24 --> 01:52:26] and like, what if all that stuff did get uncovered?
[01:52:26 --> 01:52:29] And what if somebody wasn't scared to just release all that stuff in the consequences of it?
[01:52:29 --> 01:52:31] Like, people do deserve the truth.
[01:52:31 --> 01:52:33] Like, well, they've released some of it, right?
[01:52:33 --> 01:52:35] So we know a lot about USAID now.
[01:52:35 --> 01:52:36] We know what that was.
[01:52:36 --> 01:52:39] We know what crazy programs are in place.
[01:52:39 --> 01:52:45] We know, through Mike Benz's work, where the way he describes USAID is doing things that are too dirty for the CIA.
[01:52:46 --> 01:52:52] He describes it being used as for regime change, but under the name AID, it seems like it's just AID.
[01:52:52 --> 01:52:56] Oh, we're helping people, but this agency for international development is what it really stands for.
[01:52:57 --> 01:52:59] So there's that that's been dismantled.
[01:53:00 --> 01:53:01] The thing is they're not spending less money.
[01:53:01 --> 01:53:03] They're spending more money.
[01:53:03 --> 01:53:06] There's been like a trillion dollars on the Pentagon.
[01:53:06 --> 01:53:11] It's the whole thing is kind of nuts, because nobody wants to stop spending money.
[01:53:11 --> 01:53:15] Nobody wants to lose their job, and they're all in a position where they have influence.
[01:53:15 --> 01:53:18] And there's thousands of different points of influence.
[01:53:18 --> 01:53:23] And if you're the president or the vice president or any of these fucking people,
[01:53:24 --> 01:53:25] it's a very difficult road.
[01:53:25 --> 01:53:29] The one of the things that I felt was the most important was Bobby Kennedy.
[01:53:29 --> 01:53:35] Because Bobby Kennedy getting in there, he was determined to find out what is the root cause
[01:53:35 --> 01:53:38] of America's massive health crisis that we're all facing.
[01:53:38 --> 01:53:40] Like, why are we having this?
[01:53:40 --> 01:53:45] Why do we have different toxins that are in our foods that are banned in Europe?
[01:53:45 --> 01:53:50] Why are we allowing the use of these different things that we know are terrible for the body?
[01:53:50 --> 01:53:54] You know, why is there not greater scrutiny on these pharmaceutical drug corporations?
[01:53:54 --> 01:53:58] Why are they not, you know, why are they able to lie and get away with it?
[01:53:58 --> 01:54:03] And prescribe things for people that don't need them, and not be responsible for the health
[01:54:03 --> 01:54:06] consequence of these things, and that this needs to be cleaned up.
[01:54:06 --> 01:54:07] And so that's what he's doing right now.
[01:54:08 --> 01:54:09] I'm very happy.
[01:54:09 --> 01:54:13] And I hope that he can really make meaningful changes, because it seems like he is.
[01:54:13 --> 01:54:18] He fired the 17 people that were the head of the vaccine schedule.
[01:54:18 --> 01:54:19] And he's hired a bunch of new people.
[01:54:19 --> 01:54:21] They're all very qualified.
[01:54:21 --> 01:54:24] And one of them being Robert Malone.
[01:54:24 --> 01:54:28] Robert Malone, the guy that everybody said, was a cook that I got in trouble for.
[01:54:28 --> 01:54:32] Initially, for having on my podcast, when they were trying to, you know,
[01:54:32 --> 01:54:35] when fucking Neil Young was trying to get me removed from Spotify.
[01:54:35 --> 01:54:36] This is over Robert Malone.
[01:54:36 --> 01:54:42] Robert Malone, who owns nine patents on the creation of mRNA vaccine technology.
[01:54:42 --> 01:54:46] Certifiable genius, like unquestionably, they were calling him a cook.
[01:54:46 --> 01:54:47] This guy's a cook.
[01:54:47 --> 01:54:51] A guy who took the vaccine and had a horrible reaction, they were calling him a cook.
[01:54:51 --> 01:54:56] So that guy being a part of this administration, being a part of the, you know,
[01:54:56 --> 01:54:59] make America healthy again, movement, very important.
[01:54:59 --> 01:55:03] All that's does very important for everybody, not Republicans, not Democrats.
[01:55:03 --> 01:55:07] If there's any area where we should be bipartisan on, it's that.
[01:55:07 --> 01:55:13] And realizing that corporations have taken advantage of loopholes and of a bunch of different
[01:55:13 --> 01:55:17] creepy laws that allowed them to poison you.
[01:55:17 --> 01:55:20] And you're getting poison and you're addicted to this poison.
[01:55:20 --> 01:55:21] And there's a way out of this.
[01:55:22 --> 01:55:28] Well, he's, he's kind of where I got the inspiration for the call idea from, you know, he,
[01:55:28 --> 01:55:30] no, well, he, he and I actually met.
[01:55:30 --> 01:55:34] He came out to my, he came out to the property where we filmed Richmond and all and I met him.
[01:55:34 --> 01:55:36] This was before he got linked up with Trump.
[01:55:36 --> 01:55:36] He was still running.
[01:55:36 --> 01:55:39] This is during all that and he was, he was still running for himself.
[01:55:39 --> 01:55:44] But we had a long conversation about this concept for a healing center, which is like this
[01:55:44 --> 01:55:49] thing that he's been kind of like, as a part of all this, which is like, which is kind of the
[01:55:49 --> 01:55:53] idea of people going out in the nature and like learning how to grow food and learning how to
[01:55:53 --> 01:56:00] like, because in this, in this never ending a business of chaos or everything's changing so fast
[01:56:00 --> 01:56:06] and nothing, you know, nature is, a nature has been affected by that through like some, you know,
[01:56:06 --> 01:56:11] through chemicals and technology and other things, but for the most part, it's all the systems
[01:56:11 --> 01:56:16] in nature, all the organization there and all that stuff is sort of like the last thing that's
[01:56:16 --> 01:56:20] untouched by man, you know, when you go out on two or three hundred acres and you just sit there
[01:56:20 --> 01:56:25] and you're watching the water go by, it's like, you just sort of, you take everything that we've
[01:56:25 --> 01:56:32] talked about like all this, these are all very complex, like, just crazy, century, thousands of
[01:56:32 --> 01:56:36] year-long things that man kind of done. But meanwhile, nature just sort of exists and does it's
[01:56:36 --> 01:56:42] thing and it's like, it's sort of a way to compartmentalize all this monstrosity and the one little
[01:56:42 --> 01:56:46] thing and realize that there is other, there is a reality outside of the reality that like modern
[01:56:46 --> 01:56:54] society has constructed us to exist in 24-7. That's 100%. 100%. 100%. Like, gosh, dude, that's the only thing
[01:56:54 --> 01:56:58] that saves me is like, especially being a little bit probably a little bit too introverted for
[01:56:58 --> 01:57:03] this job position, you know, going out on tour even for a week in or two or like,
[01:57:03 --> 01:57:06] dude, by the time Sunday comes and we get through this and these two mother ship shows,
[01:57:07 --> 01:57:11] we have a, we got West Virginia next weekend, but I'll spend this whole week, I probably won't
[01:57:11 --> 01:57:15] talk to anybody except for like immediate family, you know, I'll just have my, I'll just go
[01:57:15 --> 01:57:19] sit out in the woods with dogs and just watch the birds chirp and all that, but it's amazing.
[01:57:19 --> 01:57:25] There's something really important about that that I want to, I want to, I want to understand like,
[01:57:25 --> 01:57:30] you take, if you can take two or three hundred acres, like, what can you plant on it that brings in
[01:57:30 --> 01:57:36] the types of nature that benefit human beings, the most, like, I want to conduct studies on like
[01:57:36 --> 01:57:41] everything from birds to plants to wildlife to different types, like, how do you put a human being
[01:57:41 --> 01:57:47] who is so screwed up in the most optimal condition to heal and to fix? Like, as it's obviously
[01:57:47 --> 01:57:51] not the case, like, you're not going to go to a mental institution or, and I'm not even suggesting
[01:57:51 --> 01:57:55] for people who should be in a mental institution, I just mean like, you know, people who like a guy,
[01:57:55 --> 01:57:59] I know who you mentioned mushrooms and stuff, but there's a guy, I know, like, that's in the
[01:57:59 --> 01:58:03] Marines who's dealing with PTSD, like, how do you get him into a spot where he can just go out and
[01:58:03 --> 01:58:07] roll, you know, like, you can't, it's hard to, it's hard to fix that part of your brain living in a
[01:58:07 --> 01:58:13] city or living in a suburb and not having that, like, so that's, you know, so yeah, it's just like this
[01:58:13 --> 01:58:18] crazy dream I have where, like, it's sort of a, it's a way to rebel against all of this without
[01:58:18 --> 01:58:22] rebelling, it's just creating a better way to do it, but imagine if you like, this is like the
[01:58:22 --> 01:58:26] pilot program for this thing, where it's this sort of outdoor amphitheater and it's like,
[01:58:26 --> 01:58:32] very immersive in a nature and you can, and you can, like, re, re unlock these parts of your
[01:58:32 --> 01:58:35] brain, you talked about that are sort of very primitive and to us, and then, and then just emulated
[01:58:35 --> 01:58:40] over a period of time, like, so I'm doing these shows where they're, they're, they're non-profit,
[01:58:40 --> 01:58:44] and the idea is just to go into an area that hasn't had music that's in an A or B ticketing market,
[01:58:44 --> 01:58:47] do a show there, build them a blueprint, whether it's on a main street or in a farm,
[01:58:47 --> 01:58:51] field or whatever, but just somewhere where live nation and ticket master can't touch it,
[01:58:51 --> 01:58:55] build them a blueprint with, like, ingress egress promotions, how to sell the show, where to put
[01:58:55 --> 01:58:59] the stage, how to set everything up, here's all the vendors to use, and then give them this blueprint
[01:58:59 --> 01:59:03] where they can do it over and over and over again and just build, like, these sort of sanctuaries
[01:59:03 --> 01:59:08] that exist all over the country that can't be, like, molested and preyed upon by all those big companies
[01:59:08 --> 01:59:13] in all their crap, and I think inherently by doing that through, like, music and public speaking,
[01:59:13 --> 01:59:18] and other things, those spaces will almost serve as, like, like, the way that communities thrive,
[01:59:18 --> 01:59:24] again, and the way people reconnect, and I joke and say that, like, everyone, every human being,
[01:59:24 --> 01:59:29] like, music and food, and socializing, at least a little bit, and if you don't, you're probably
[01:59:29 --> 01:59:34] a robot, and I don't want you there anyway, kind of a thing, you know, but, like, so that's,
[01:59:34 --> 01:59:37] that's in an nutshell, but that all was inspired by Bobby's sort of idea for this healing
[01:59:37 --> 01:59:41] center that he talked about. I think it's a place over in Italy that he used as a reference
[01:59:41 --> 01:59:45] of, um, he had a relative go to, and, like, they were able to work with, like, a leather and do all the
[01:59:45 --> 01:59:50] stuff on a vineyard, I think, and it, like, it had a, there's a lot of, you know, we know very little
[01:59:50 --> 01:59:53] about the human mind, that's why psychedelics are still illegal, and so, and there's so much
[01:59:53 --> 01:59:58] misunderstanding and misconception and just confusion even there, because, I mean, like, our brains are
[01:59:58 --> 02:00:00] so, and infinitely calm.
[00:00:00 --> 00:00:03] Plex, even, you know, uh, yeah.
[00:00:03 --> 00:00:06] So they're definitely a part of your health without nature.
[00:00:06 --> 00:00:08] I don't think you're really get totally healthy.
[00:00:08 --> 00:00:11] We're a part of nature, you know, like we're a natural thing,
[00:00:11 --> 00:00:13] existing in a world that we've created that isn't natural.
[00:00:13 --> 00:00:16] And so like this is all, you know, like this is all,
[00:00:16 --> 00:00:20] everything that we've talked about is just sort of man-made, constructed bullshit
[00:00:20 --> 00:00:22] that is now, that is now reality to us.
[00:00:22 --> 00:00:25] But there, but it's just part of a bigger thing, too,
[00:00:25 --> 00:00:28] that it's, we sort of get isolated inside of a special one
[00:00:28 --> 00:00:29] on her phone all the time.
[00:00:29 --> 00:00:31] It's like, yeah, especially.
[00:00:31 --> 00:00:34] I played off social media and it's amazing.
[00:00:34 --> 00:00:37] It's like, it lifts this weight off your brain.
[00:00:37 --> 00:00:41] How do you manage social, this is one thing I really have a hard time with.
[00:00:41 --> 00:00:45] And it makes, I feel bad because I end up upsetting people or whatever, but like,
[00:00:46 --> 00:00:50] how do you, a lot of people want your time and they want to send you text messages
[00:00:50 --> 00:00:52] and they want to bother you with stuff and they want to,
[00:00:52 --> 00:00:54] and it's not anything they want to bother you.
[00:00:54 --> 00:00:56] They really, but like how do you manage that?
[00:00:56 --> 00:00:57] Do you just have a small social circle?
[00:00:57 --> 00:01:00] Are you just really social or like, how do you find,
[00:01:00 --> 00:01:03] there's people where I just want text and back for like months and then they,
[00:01:03 --> 00:01:04] then they think I hate them and it's not that I hate them.
[00:01:04 --> 00:01:09] It's just like, I can't just sit and text, I just can't send hundreds of text every day to it.
[00:01:09 --> 00:01:13] Like, I have to, like, how do you balance all that or how do you get to keep changing your phone number?
[00:01:15 --> 00:01:18] But you also got to get comfortable with not texting people back,
[00:01:18 --> 00:01:20] because you can't text everybody back.
[00:01:20 --> 00:01:20] Yeah.
[00:01:20 --> 00:01:22] Look at my phone, I want to see something.
[00:01:22 --> 00:01:23] I'll show you this.
[00:01:24 --> 00:01:28] Look, it could see how many unread text messages I have.
[00:01:29 --> 00:01:30] I've got an upper left hand corner.
[00:01:30 --> 00:01:31] What does it say?
[00:01:32 --> 00:01:34] 623.
[00:01:34 --> 00:01:35] Yeah, good luck.
[00:01:35 --> 00:01:36] Yeah.
[00:01:36 --> 00:01:36] How?
[00:01:37 --> 00:01:38] How am I going to read those?
[00:01:38 --> 00:01:39] I know.
[00:01:40 --> 00:01:41] Well, I've got a possible.
[00:01:42 --> 00:01:46] I think it goes back to my, when I was at work before and I had to keep up with the phone for work,
[00:01:46 --> 00:01:51] and I had, you know, it's like, it's just instilled to me that like it just drives,
[00:01:51 --> 00:01:52] so I don't know, that's why yeah.
[00:01:52 --> 00:01:54] I've, I've bought that flip phone that I carry.
[00:01:54 --> 00:01:57] And there's a time to move, to get, move, you get your brain back.
[00:01:57 --> 00:02:01] It's also tough, though, because there's people I do want to say in contact with, like,
[00:02:01 --> 00:02:04] you know, like, but you can always reach out to them.
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:04] Yeah.
[00:02:04 --> 00:02:09] It's like, you know, we have this idea of immediate interaction with people that it's necessary.
[00:02:09 --> 00:02:10] It's important.
[00:02:10 --> 00:02:12] And sometimes it is important, like, maybe there's something going on.
[00:02:12 --> 00:02:15] Maybe your wife is pregnant, like, who knows, right?
[00:02:15 --> 00:02:18] You need immediate contact, but most of the time you don't.
[00:02:18 --> 00:02:20] The vast majority of the time you're done.
[00:02:20 --> 00:02:22] We live the long time without it.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:22] Yeah.
[00:02:22 --> 00:02:26] I mean, you don't want to not be there for somebody who needs you in an emergency,
[00:02:26 --> 00:02:30] but other than that, it's good to be free.
[00:02:30 --> 00:02:32] You just, it's better for your brain.
[00:02:32 --> 00:02:36] I don't, like I was saying, I don't think we're supposed to be getting the bad news
[00:02:36 --> 00:02:37] from 8 billion people.
[00:02:37 --> 00:02:38] It's just too nuts.
[00:02:38 --> 00:02:41] It's a little, we're just, I don't think we're even supposed to socialize with that,
[00:02:41 --> 00:02:46] maybe, I mean, we thrive in smaller, I mean, that's why all these, yeah,
[00:02:46 --> 00:02:48] like, we, we definitely thrive in smaller.
[00:02:48 --> 00:02:49] Yeah.
[00:02:49 --> 00:02:50] Keep a tight tribe.
[00:02:50 --> 00:02:51] Yeah.
[00:02:51 --> 00:02:52] Keep a tight tribe.
[00:02:52 --> 00:02:57] Keep a tight tribe of people that are cool and make it so it's beneficial to everybody,
[00:02:57 --> 00:02:58] so there's no resentment.
[00:02:58 --> 00:03:04] You know, one of the things that happens when a guy gets really famous, like you're getting,
[00:03:04 --> 00:03:10] is that someone, you can have the wrong people around you, you know, maybe you, like,
[00:03:10 --> 00:03:14] look past some of the resentful behavior that they showed when you weren't successful,
[00:03:14 --> 00:03:17] and then it manifests itself when you're successful,
[00:03:17 --> 00:03:20] you can tell, like, someone around you actually wants you to fuck up,
[00:03:20 --> 00:03:22] and that's a tear, I've seen that happen with friends.
[00:03:22 --> 00:03:24] It's a terrible place to be.
[00:03:24 --> 00:03:27] There just has to be some kind of way that I don't have to be famous, though.
[00:03:27 --> 00:03:31] Like, there's a way where this is, yeah, but there's a way where this is, like, I'm just,
[00:03:32 --> 00:03:35] like, I don't know, it's gotten a lot better, but um,
[00:03:35 --> 00:03:36] you're just going to have to deal with it.
[00:03:36 --> 00:03:40] Like, this is the path that you've been given in this world.
[00:03:40 --> 00:03:43] I just mean that, I just mean that, like, I should, like, I just don't want,
[00:03:43 --> 00:03:45] faint, I just don't want people to perceive.
[00:03:45 --> 00:03:50] Like, I'm just some dude that's written a song and work, but this is like a collect,
[00:03:50 --> 00:03:53] like I said, this is a collective thing, like the fact, just, if you look at the,
[00:03:53 --> 00:03:57] if you look at the right of people who buy my songs on iTunes versus most label artists,
[00:03:57 --> 00:04:03] it's, like, comically disproportionate, like, people buy my songs out of support and stuff.
[00:04:03 --> 00:04:07] And so what I'm saying is that this is like a thing, like, this isn't just,
[00:04:07 --> 00:04:09] I'm sitting up here and y'all are all down there.
[00:04:09 --> 00:04:12] Like, this is, in my mind, this is just a thing where we're all equal,
[00:04:13 --> 00:04:17] it just happens to be, this is the music, this is the music catalog that we're given people in
[00:04:17 --> 00:04:22] middle finger with, but I don't, I wouldn't for a second want to ever think that, like,
[00:04:22 --> 00:04:25] that I'm above somebody else on some social hierarchy because of it or something I guess.
[00:04:25 --> 00:04:28] I don't want to feel, like, I, this is not necessary.
[00:04:28 --> 00:04:32] This is just something where, like, I just, I'm just so excited to see where this can go in the sense of,
[00:04:32 --> 00:04:38] like, like, like I said, it's just exciting that, like, like, some, just full-blown 80,
[00:04:38 --> 00:04:42] like me, with a couple of his buddies can figure out how to do this and rally enough support
[00:04:42 --> 00:04:45] up behind it. I'm just, like, what could really happen if, like, what could really happen if
[00:04:45 --> 00:04:50] things were like, if I actually knew what I was doing or if, like, enough of us got together,
[00:04:50 --> 00:04:55] like, we could really just flip, we could just flip everything upside down pretty quick and it'd be hilarious.
[00:04:55 --> 00:05:01] You don't have to become a different thing just because you're famous. That's a myth.
[00:05:01 --> 00:05:04] You know, you don't have to become better than people. You don't have to think you're better than
[00:05:04 --> 00:05:07] people just because you're famous. You can maintain who you are. It's totally doable.
[00:05:07 --> 00:05:12] Totally. Yeah. Why do it? I'm just me. I'm the same person. You are. Yeah.
[00:05:12 --> 00:05:15] I've been doing it the same and that's one of the reasons why I do the podcast the exact same
[00:05:15 --> 00:05:19] way. I do it the same way. I don't think, oh, this is going to be a big one.
[00:05:19 --> 00:05:23] Everybody asks, that's the first thing a lot of people ask is, how was Joe Rogan? And I was like,
[00:05:23 --> 00:05:29] he's Joe Rogan, like, there is no so much easier that way. Just be you all day.
[00:05:29 --> 00:05:33] Yeah, like, if you've watched him on the podcast, you've seen him in real life. He's, you know,
[00:05:33 --> 00:05:38] he's seen me at my worst, he's seen me at my best. That's it. But, you know, a human being,
[00:05:38 --> 00:05:42] just like anybody else. This is why I encourage everybody who wants to do something like this to
[00:05:42 --> 00:05:48] go do it. Anybody can do this. Exactly. You might not do it this well immediately because you're
[00:05:48 --> 00:05:52] going to learn how to do it. But it's like everything. You can learn how to do it. Like you
[00:05:52 --> 00:05:56] you can learn how to sing. You can learn how to do stand up. You can learn how to play guitar. You
[00:05:56 --> 00:06:01] can learn how to draw. You can learn it. Oh, I can never do that. Yeah, can. Some people can do it
[00:06:01 --> 00:06:06] better than you. Some people are naturally talented in different areas. You know, especially when
[00:06:06 --> 00:06:11] it comes to athletics. But you can do it. You can do it. You can get better. Everything and
[00:06:11 --> 00:06:16] getting better at something and doing something is beneficial to the whole of your life.
[00:06:16 --> 00:06:21] Because if you can apply that same, those same principles to everything, you can get better at
[00:06:21 --> 00:06:26] everything. And you get better at being a person. And inspire other people. Like, yeah, like the
[00:06:26 --> 00:06:30] more, the more good that you can do and the more you can put out, the more it inspires others to do
[00:06:30 --> 00:06:35] too. Yeah, the more work you put out too. The more songs you put out, like Scornful Woman,
[00:06:35 --> 00:06:40] the more stuff that really resonates with people. It affects people, man. It's like you,
[00:06:40 --> 00:06:44] it's that wings of the butterfly, man. You know, you're like, you're really like spreading it out.
[00:06:44 --> 00:06:49] And, you know, it'll inspire more people to write songs. It'll inspire more people to do things.
[00:06:49 --> 00:06:55] It'll inspire people to write books. It's just that's what we do. We inspire people. People inspire
[00:06:55 --> 00:07:00] people. And people by doing something that we know is difficult. And they get through it and they
[00:07:00 --> 00:07:05] create something like, wow, and you go to see, you know, fucking you too with this fear. Like,
[00:07:05 --> 00:07:10] wow. Yeah. You know, that's what it's all about, man. You know, that's that's the beautiful thing
[00:07:10 --> 00:07:18] that is this kind of artistic connection that you have with the community, with the people that
[00:07:18 --> 00:07:22] that enjoy your work. As long as you respect that and as long as you understand what it is,
[00:07:23 --> 00:07:28] you'll be great. You're just going to have to deal with being famous. You know, I have to,
[00:07:28 --> 00:07:32] I have to, you know, like I do, I do think you're actually right. I probably was a little
[00:07:34 --> 00:07:38] misspoke, and now that you say what you said about AI being able to replace music and stuff,
[00:07:38 --> 00:07:44] I do agree that like there is a part of it that AI will never, they'll never understand the human
[00:07:44 --> 00:07:48] experience enough to be able to write music about it that's that captivates people in a way that
[00:07:48 --> 00:07:53] music can that's been written by people. I do agree with that. You know, they can make it sound
[00:07:53 --> 00:07:58] better and cooler and catch year. But I do think like I do think the people that are really
[00:07:58 --> 00:08:02] writing it are the ones that and the ones that really write. I mean, like just to talk about the
[00:08:02 --> 00:08:10] songwriting process was scoring full. You know, we were, I had been, we had just gotten done with
[00:08:10 --> 00:08:17] the touring over the summer for the most part in 2024. And well, obviously, things are what they
[00:08:17 --> 00:08:21] are, but there's just been, there was just a like multiple different negative things happening
[00:08:21 --> 00:08:25] at once and I kind of got into, I got into spot where I did my thing where I sort of spiral
[00:08:25 --> 00:08:31] and this was isolating myself and so I spent a month and a half or two months in that house pretty
[00:08:31 --> 00:08:37] much. I didn't do, I didn't do Thanksgiving or Christmas last year. I just, just do really didn't
[00:08:37 --> 00:08:43] hardly talk to anybody or anything. And so I was like, at a, you know, I was in a, it was in a position
[00:08:43 --> 00:08:48] where it was like probably time to write a song like that. And there's a few things I do want to
[00:08:48 --> 00:08:54] clarify to, what, talking about this. But so anyway, so me, Draven from ADWV and Joey are all sitting
[00:08:54 --> 00:08:58] in the kitchen of this house where we recorded the song and it's probably in the fall sometime.
[00:08:58 --> 00:09:06] And Joey is three in the morning, right? And we were all just like wired and I can think about Joey
[00:09:06 --> 00:09:10] talking about really wanting to write a song. And so him and Draven were asking me about my song
[00:09:10 --> 00:09:15] writing process and what I do and so like I just went and got the guitar and I said we were sitting
[00:09:15 --> 00:09:19] there around the table and I can remember it was me and Joey sitting here and Draven leaning up against
[00:09:19 --> 00:09:22] the counter and we were just talking about it and I said, well, I said, if you're going to write a song,
[00:09:22 --> 00:09:25] I was like, the first thing you got to do is figure out what you're going to write about and it's
[00:09:25 --> 00:09:29] got to be something that you feel, not something that you can just articulate about. It's got to be
[00:09:29 --> 00:09:33] something that's like in there that needs to come out, you know, and so we sat there for like 10 seconds and
[00:09:34 --> 00:09:39] scornful woman was the word that was used, you know, and it was like, it was, it was,
[00:09:39 --> 00:09:44] it was specific relationships, but also it was a collection of all, like the experiences that we had all
[00:09:44 --> 00:09:48] had, like I think, in horrible, we'd all had horrible relationships too. And the, of course, we all
[00:09:48 --> 00:09:53] have, you know, like every dude on earth has been, has been through what that song talks about in one
[00:09:53 --> 00:09:56] way or another. Can we play it? Let's, let's queue it up. Yeah. Let's queue it up. Jamie,
[00:09:56 --> 00:10:00] queue it up. But within two or three minutes, the whole song was written. It was just,
[00:10:00 --> 00:10:05] It just came out, you know, and that's, and the AI is not going to do that.
[00:10:05 --> 00:10:11] There's something, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's things that resonate and that's all that AI is never going to be able to understand.
[00:10:11 --> 00:10:18] Yeah. Yeah. And that's the thing. That's the thing that's going to separate people from the machine and live performance.
[00:10:18 --> 00:10:22] That, this kind of stuff. This kind of stuff right here.
[00:10:22 --> 00:10:25] Mercer County, West Virginia.
[00:10:52 --> 00:11:00] Grab the apple, and add-on, took a bite, and now all these years and some later.
[00:11:00 --> 00:11:04] And the mask still ain't right with a score.
[00:11:04 --> 00:11:15] It's a score, and a score, and a score, and a score, and a score.
[00:11:16 --> 00:11:22] I guess the sleep's so good, didn't have a night.
[00:11:22 --> 00:11:28] I was busy dreaming, believing he's always going to be right.
[00:11:28 --> 00:11:35] There, and now the middle of the day, he's like the middle of the night.
[00:11:35 --> 00:11:43] And the court says 50-50, but the mask's on the same height with a score.
[00:11:43 --> 00:11:50] It's a score, and a score, and a score, and a score.
[00:12:13 --> 00:12:22] But she can have all the money.
[00:12:22 --> 00:12:28] And they can keep all the fame.
[00:12:28 --> 00:12:38] I go back to being broke as a joke if I could just get a break from the pain.
[00:13:13 --> 00:13:26] It's in the description of the video, but there's a, the biggest shout out of all this is to the, there's a firefighter that we,
[00:13:26 --> 00:13:29] he let us use this footage, too. I think it's out of Brazil.
[00:13:29 --> 00:13:34] But the name of the firefighters in the description, but for the GoPro footage, it was really cool he let us use that.
[00:13:34 --> 00:13:36] Oh, that's a real fire.
[00:13:36 --> 00:13:39] Yeah, that's a real firefighting GoPro video that we found.
[00:13:39 --> 00:13:42] And we reached out to the guy and asked him if we could use it.
[00:13:42 --> 00:13:45] But I just wanted to give him a shout out on here.
[00:13:45 --> 00:13:51] Joe said, find your firefighter for third company, bomb low-screen dose.
[00:13:51 --> 00:13:53] In Chile, sorry, yeah.
[00:13:53 --> 00:13:54] That's awesome.
[00:13:54 --> 00:13:58] I've been, my mind's been in the kind of a blur lately, so I should have remembered that, right?
[00:13:58 --> 00:14:00] But, as far as we got it, that's awesome.
[00:14:00 --> 00:14:01] Yeah.
[00:14:01 --> 00:14:02] Fucking song, dude.
[00:14:02 --> 00:14:03] Woo!
[00:14:03 --> 00:14:05] That song's a firecracker.
[00:14:05 --> 00:14:09] I can't wait for you to hear some of the, like, let me turn.
[00:14:10 --> 00:14:11] I'll turn this on.
[00:14:11 --> 00:14:14] I'll play, like, just, like, I'll leak, like, 20 seconds and one of the other one.
[00:14:14 --> 00:14:16] Like, when is it going to come out?
[00:14:16 --> 00:14:19] I don't know when the next one's will.
[00:14:19 --> 00:14:21] I don't even want to say a day, because I don't know.
[00:14:21 --> 00:14:22] I'm such a procrast.
[00:14:22 --> 00:14:24] I want to say, like, within a month or so.
[00:14:24 --> 00:14:25] Like, what are you doing with it?
[00:14:25 --> 00:14:27] You're changing anything on it?
[00:14:27 --> 00:14:29] I'm just not releasing it yet.
[00:14:29 --> 00:14:30] Just not.
[00:14:30 --> 00:14:32] I've just got, I just need to get my life together.
[00:14:32 --> 00:14:34] I'm just releasing it right now.
[00:14:34 --> 00:14:36] Just releasing it right now.
[00:14:36 --> 00:14:37] Put it out on the show.
[00:14:37 --> 00:14:38] Send it to Jamie.
[00:14:39 --> 00:14:41] I'll play, like, 30 seconds.
[00:14:41 --> 00:14:44] I don't even have, like, a, I don't even have, like, a full file of anything on here.
[00:14:44 --> 00:14:46] I've just got stuff that I've recorded off my phone.
[00:14:46 --> 00:14:49] But just to give you an idea of, like, some of the other stuff I'm working on.
[00:14:49 --> 00:14:53] Like, this one, let me see.
[00:14:53 --> 00:14:55] Which one of these?
[00:14:55 --> 00:14:57] They're all just, like, new recording for 32.
[00:14:57 --> 00:15:01] So I gotta remember, which, like, probably this one's probably one.
[00:15:01 --> 00:15:05] I don't know if this'll be right or not, but this'll give you an idea of something.
[00:15:06 --> 00:15:07] I don't know, actually.
[00:15:07 --> 00:15:09] So it's an idea of what this is.
[00:15:09 --> 00:15:10] I don't know if this'll be right or not.
[00:15:10 --> 00:15:12] It's just way too easy.
[00:15:12 --> 00:15:13] I don't know, maybe.
[00:15:13 --> 00:15:15] I want to see how I feel.
[00:15:15 --> 00:15:17] I'm just feeling.
[00:15:22 --> 00:15:23] All right.
[00:15:23 --> 00:15:24] All right.
[00:15:24 --> 00:15:25] All right.
[00:15:25 --> 00:15:26] What do you mean?
[00:15:26 --> 00:15:27] All right.
[00:15:27 --> 00:15:28] All right.
[00:15:28 --> 00:15:29] What do you mean?
[00:15:29 --> 00:15:31] You're going to find me.
[00:15:31 --> 00:15:43] I just got a bunch of little clips like that of where we were practice in the guitar parts,
[00:15:43 --> 00:15:48] but anyway, I got a few more that are like pretty heavy. I don't know what they are. I don't
[00:15:48 --> 00:15:53] know people figure it out. They're something. I don't even, I don't like to even try to describe
[00:15:53 --> 00:15:56] many of that stuff because I don't know what it is, but so are you going to release it all
[00:15:56 --> 00:16:00] as a full album or you're going to just do it like, song at a time. Probably just song
[00:16:00 --> 00:16:06] at a time right now just because it's simpler that way. Yeah, and then I'll just, I don't
[00:16:06 --> 00:16:10] know what I'm going to, I don't know what the long term plan is. I want to get, I'll get
[00:16:10 --> 00:16:15] to the end of this tour this year in October and you don't need a long term plan. Just keep
[00:16:15 --> 00:16:20] doing what you like doing. Yeah, I will. Yeah, this all long term plan, shit. That's people
[00:16:20 --> 00:16:24] with vision boards. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I know you're right. I haven't taken, I've just tried
[00:16:24 --> 00:16:28] to take it. I do have to think long term though because I want to make the most of
[00:16:28 --> 00:16:33] this just for, I don't know, man. The only thing I want, like, I just want to look back
[00:16:33 --> 00:16:38] when I'm old and just think like, just think like, fuck yeah, we did it. Like we did
[00:16:38 --> 00:16:42] just keep doing what you're doing. You will do that 100%. Yeah, but I'm a bigger, I just
[00:16:42 --> 00:16:47] want to see, like I just want to see the, I just want to, I don't know, I just want to
[00:16:47 --> 00:16:51] watch the machine crumble, you know, like I just, I have this like thing and it's
[00:16:51 --> 00:16:58] probably crumble on its own. It'll still exist in some form. But, you know, as long
[00:16:58 --> 00:17:05] as you can thrive without it, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. And more
[00:17:05 --> 00:17:09] people realize that there's a way to do it that's authentic. There's always going to be
[00:17:09 --> 00:17:12] people that are drawn to that and it'll be more and more people as things get more and
[00:17:12 --> 00:17:17] more disconnected and feel less and less human. Yeah. There's just more and more. There's
[00:17:17 --> 00:17:21] been so many big people go up against it and not be able to quite figure it out, like
[00:17:21 --> 00:17:25] even Pearl Jam back in the 90s, you know, trying to go up against, I think live nation
[00:17:25 --> 00:17:30] it was or take it master. And I don't know, man, I just want to see, that's like that would
[00:17:30 --> 00:17:35] be my biggest, that would be the biggest thing that I would feel some sense of accomplishment
[00:17:35 --> 00:17:38] about long time. It's like, just how do you get all these people together who have been
[00:17:38 --> 00:17:43] disenfranchised by the music industry and just rally them together in a way that, like,
[00:17:43 --> 00:17:47] it's not to take anyone down or to do anything bad at all towards anybody, but it's just
[00:17:47 --> 00:17:52] like, imagine what society would be with the real music again without a bunch of label
[00:17:52 --> 00:17:56] propped up shit and every stuck in everybody's head. Like, what if people really listen
[00:17:56 --> 00:18:01] to what they loved and, like, and, like, it was real, it was like the organic side of things
[00:18:01 --> 00:18:04] is what drove music through the roof. Like, imagine what that would, imagine what, can
[00:18:04 --> 00:18:07] think about what music can do to you, like, not even in the moment, but just what it
[00:18:07 --> 00:18:13] means to you over time. Like, going back and I go back all the time, like, and I listen
[00:18:13 --> 00:18:20] to, like, a 1999 live, like, like a live, staying session or something from back then
[00:18:20 --> 00:18:25] and just, or, like, old Hank Williams, the third songs or, like, I don't know stuff I
[00:18:25 --> 00:18:29] listened to a lot as a kid and, like, man, it was unlock all these memories. You think
[00:18:29 --> 00:18:32] about, like, all of a sudden, you're, like, back in a place that you never even remembered
[00:18:32 --> 00:18:37] you ever were. It's just, it's such a powerful thing on us, you know. So I'm sorry,
[00:18:37 --> 00:18:41] I just miss you. Yeah, but that's, yeah, it was powerful, man. It's powerful to do what you're
[00:18:41 --> 00:18:46] doing. What you're doing is that, you're doing that. Yeah, you're not doing that. I'm not doing
[00:18:46 --> 00:18:51] that. You're, shut the fuck up. You are. You are. You're in that groove. You know, just keep
[00:18:51 --> 00:18:54] doing what you're doing. It's awesome. And it's inspiring and more people are going to do
[00:18:54 --> 00:18:58] it. And I love that you want to help more people do it. That's great. Because I'm guarantee
[00:18:58 --> 00:19:02] you, there are these Charlie Croquets out there. There's these guys out there that people
[00:19:02 --> 00:19:06] haven't heard of before. And then you see I'm playing on street corner one day and you're
[00:19:06 --> 00:19:11] like, where are you from? Like, how are you doing this? This is crazy. Yeah. You know, there's
[00:19:11 --> 00:19:13] people like that out there in the world. I remember we went, what was that place that we
[00:19:13 --> 00:19:19] went to, saw Ellis Bullard, the White, what is it called? White horse? Yeah. Yeah. And we're
[00:19:19 --> 00:19:22] like, who is this fucking guy here in town, right? Yeah, nobody there. The way we went there
[00:19:22 --> 00:19:26] last time, we were here. We're playing on going, that was actually thinking about trying
[00:19:26 --> 00:19:29] to swing by there this evening. It was a little spot. That was so much fun last night. Great
[00:19:29 --> 00:19:32] little spot. So there's people like that out there. You know, they just have to get it
[00:19:32 --> 00:19:38] in audience. Yeah. Yeah. Someone has to, you know, get a little boost. Reach back, grab
[00:19:38 --> 00:19:43] the other hand, help them up. Yeah. That's one of the best things about the comedy community
[00:19:43 --> 00:19:47] right now. So we all do that for each other. So it's like, there's a real pathway. So there's
[00:19:47 --> 00:19:51] a lot of people that are moving to Austin from all across the country. You know, that like,
[00:19:51 --> 00:19:55] hey, I think if I get there, that's a place where you could really launch from. What's
[00:19:55 --> 00:19:59] powerful about your platforms here, like you and just, and all the other people, like
[00:19:59 --> 00:20:00] you said that are in that net.
[00:20:00 --> 00:20:05] work is that you this is all stuff that you've built that you have control over like these are
[00:20:06 --> 00:20:11] that's what's cool about is it's like the sort of new it's a whole new business that you've
[00:20:11 --> 00:20:16] kind of got here like in the comedy world it's not it's not owned by anybody or anything it's
[00:20:16 --> 00:20:21] like it's wild and free and chaotic and it could go anywhere and that's what's that's what's
[00:20:21 --> 00:20:27] exciting to me it's like dude like I said I just don't know I just don't know what who knows
[00:20:27 --> 00:20:33] what will even come of what you got going on here and and Austin but this has has shaped a lot like
[00:20:33 --> 00:20:39] you know in a world where everything is so it's so predicted like there's less and less people
[00:20:39 --> 00:20:43] able to sit around in a board room and a skyscraper somewhere and decide what the next big
[00:20:43 --> 00:20:48] thing is going to be it's like it's more it's I don't know it's just it's exciting to be a part of that
[00:20:48 --> 00:20:53] despite all the there's so many ways that you can you can look negatively about everything going on
[00:20:53 --> 00:20:57] but there is this sort of transfer of power that I just hope can happen and we only have a very
[00:20:57 --> 00:21:02] short window of time for it to happen and you know pretty soon pretty soon well I'll have a
[00:21:02 --> 00:21:09] neural link and we'll be we'll be talking each other and people you know but we've got a little bit of
[00:21:09 --> 00:21:14] time maybe before that yeah maybe I think we're the last real people we're the last people that
[00:21:14 --> 00:21:20] knows what it was like before to understand what's what like what real life really is and it's so hard
[00:21:20 --> 00:21:27] even say what that what that even means but I just mean that like even already there's people on
[00:21:27 --> 00:21:32] YouTube that that comment on a video that's AI everyone in it's AI the whole narrative isn't
[00:21:32 --> 00:21:36] it'll have like a million and like probably half the people commenting on it or bots too but I just
[00:21:36 --> 00:21:40] mean that it's not even like we're going to be to see that way I think it's some point it'll almost
[00:21:40 --> 00:21:46] somehow somehow it'll come to a point where we won't really understand what is real life or what
[00:21:46 --> 00:21:51] is digitally artificially created and it won't even it's not that we won't even be able to tell
[00:21:51 --> 00:21:57] the difference but we won't even care to tell the difference the fake world will feel more real
[00:21:57 --> 00:22:03] than the real world and a short beard at times somehow like it'll it'll it'll influence our our
[00:22:03 --> 00:22:09] sensory like it'll it'll it'll it'll influence that more than real life will like it'll become just like
[00:22:09 --> 00:22:12] everything will just feels I mean it already feels that way that's what we're so drawn and all but
[00:22:12 --> 00:22:18] as it all becomes more realistic and more creative and more tailored to to draw us and it will be
[00:22:19 --> 00:22:24] just mass deception this is probably it might have already happened this is what's really
[00:22:24 --> 00:22:30] terrifying is the simulation theory the idea that oh I would be able to know if it was simulation
[00:22:30 --> 00:22:35] would you I don't know you know Elon thinks it's simulation he thinks the chances of it not
[00:22:35 --> 00:22:43] being a simulation or in the billions he thinks that this whole thing is probably our consciousness
[00:22:43 --> 00:22:50] interacting with a program which is very bizarre to think but if you keep going with what we're doing
[00:22:50 --> 00:22:59] right now that is inevitable if you look at the way technology is recreating things with AI and making things
[00:22:59 --> 00:23:04] look completely realistic and then you you extrapolate you look into the future 20 30 40 50 years
[00:23:04 --> 00:23:10] yeah they're going to be able to give you an experience that's you're not going to know so how do you know
[00:23:10 --> 00:23:14] if that's already happened and maybe that's how the world actually works maybe this idea the material
[00:23:14 --> 00:23:21] world is an illusion and that everything is your consciousness interacting we're only able to
[00:23:21 --> 00:23:29] perceive reality through limited means I mean site sound smell etc like there's there could be
[00:23:29 --> 00:23:34] components of reality here that we're not able to see I mean and that's where like I definitely
[00:23:34 --> 00:23:38] lean into recognizing that there is this whole like I do believe there is this whole spiritual
[00:23:38 --> 00:23:44] element it play to and I see yeah it's just it's hard to it's just no there's no way to tell but
[00:23:44 --> 00:23:48] this it's kind of like it's funny though because the same mentality that you could use to think
[00:23:48 --> 00:23:52] about the world being a simulation you could also think about it being I mean it's so organized
[00:23:52 --> 00:23:57] and so perfect that yeah I agree that it's operating on some program I just think that that program
[00:23:57 --> 00:24:03] is being mandated and created by by what is represented in my mind is God or you know Jesus Christ
[00:24:03 --> 00:24:08] other people may just be considered like a like a software or program but it is all the same thing
[00:24:08 --> 00:24:13] obviously there is some like life is a thing that we don't quite understand that that finds itself
[00:24:13 --> 00:24:19] in the midst of so many different parts of reality like life like just in the soil there's so many
[00:24:19 --> 00:24:23] different millions of bacteria that just make it possible for stuff to even be able to grow and all
[00:24:23 --> 00:24:26] those things are arguably intelligent and have these organized systems and then you see the
[00:24:26 --> 00:24:33] way birds flying the sky and just the way that like the way that even we have these sort of inherent
[00:24:33 --> 00:24:39] parts program and it's just it's there's really no way to tell but what's so funny is that
[00:24:39 --> 00:24:43] and just a short period of time will all be forgotten about anyway and we'll never really know and
[00:24:43 --> 00:24:47] maybe even this even this technology that is existed has existed before and we'll go away again
[00:24:47 --> 00:24:51] it's just no way to really tell I think at the end of the day like to your point I think humanity
[00:24:51 --> 00:24:56] and the truth within it is all that really exists and everything else just sort of swirls about
[00:24:56 --> 00:25:03] and we're always wanting to expand upon what already exists you know we're not creatures that like
[00:25:03 --> 00:25:08] repetition or we like to just always figure out what the next big thing is even if it is our
[00:25:08 --> 00:25:14] demands you know it's weird we're sort of chasing the buildings to build our replacements somehow
[00:25:14 --> 00:25:19] I don't know oh that's a fact yeah we're definitely doing that no question at all we've
[00:25:19 --> 00:25:24] already replaced our memory with your contact list I mean how many numbers I know like three
[00:25:24 --> 00:25:27] people's phone numbers I used to know everyone's phone number I used to be able to
[00:25:27 --> 00:25:31] rattle off all my friends phone numbers I used to be the column from a payphone that was how
[00:25:31 --> 00:25:36] I got a whole people back in the day now don't remember anything I remember my high school phone
[00:25:36 --> 00:25:42] number that I had when I was a kid I don't remember my best friends phone number I can
[00:25:42 --> 00:25:46] remember my best friend phone number from high school he still has it and I'll still text him now
[00:25:46 --> 00:25:51] and then it's yeah but that's great but it's crazy that your contact list is replaced your
[00:25:51 --> 00:25:57] memory yeah yeah and then you know anytime you have a question you just press that button on your
[00:25:57 --> 00:26:03] phone hey you know what year was this you know what year was get his bird what year you know
[00:26:03 --> 00:26:09] and you can find anything it's intentionally and that's good but it's also weird because
[00:26:09 --> 00:26:12] now you're dependent upon that thing and you're connected to that thing that thing is just going
[00:26:12 --> 00:26:16] to get more and more part of your life whereas you said before you can't even leave your house without
[00:26:16 --> 00:26:20] your phone you feel weird yeah but that all those resources right now are used because there
[00:26:20 --> 00:26:29] is no like real protocol or way for us to be necessarily productive with it like like in a broader
[00:26:29 --> 00:26:33] spectrum that a lot of people just use all those tools and resources as just endless entertainment
[00:26:33 --> 00:26:38] in mind numbing distraction but really all that stuff is makes us super powerful if we're able
[00:26:38 --> 00:26:42] to harness it correctly like I said like like just imagine imagine imagine the the information in
[00:26:42 --> 00:26:47] the data and the resources that we have access to that people like kings and dictators and
[00:26:47 --> 00:26:51] empers and the the most powerful people in the world could have never dreamed like we have it just
[00:26:51 --> 00:26:56] right here for free on our phone like well I think we don't realize how informed we are in comparison
[00:26:56 --> 00:27:02] to people in the past people in the past works extremely naive about the way things work just that
[00:27:02 --> 00:27:07] has just been something that we have just accepted as being normal in the last 20 years but
[00:27:07 --> 00:27:14] it's not normal it's not normal to know this much about congressional insider trading you know
[00:27:14 --> 00:27:17] like how do we all know about that now and how how do we all know that it's been going on forever
[00:27:17 --> 00:27:22] nobody did anything about it you know there's a lot of things that we know now that make the people
[00:27:22 --> 00:27:28] the powers that be very creeped out you know including things like podcasts they don't like it at
[00:27:28 --> 00:27:34] all that there's no one that no corporate entity pulling the strings behind the scenes it's just
[00:27:34 --> 00:27:40] people and that some person like a Theo Vaughn or whoever can have whoever they want on
[00:27:40 --> 00:27:44] any time they want and say whatever they want and that person might say some wild shit that has
[00:27:44 --> 00:27:49] the internet scrambling is this true and then they have to google it they don't like that at all
[00:27:49 --> 00:27:55] they don't like that this affects elections that people realize like hey you're being lied to hey
[00:27:55 --> 00:28:00] the FBI contacted Facebook it was telling them to remove factual information because it might
[00:28:00 --> 00:28:07] affect the election like well this is crazy like the stuff that we know now that a lot of people
[00:28:07 --> 00:28:16] know now was the stuff of conspiracy fantasy when I was 20 years old but what does it really
[00:28:16 --> 00:28:20] what does it mean to us though because yeah we know all that about Facebook but we all still use
[00:28:20 --> 00:28:30] Facebook like like it's um I think that now our our ability to communicate as becomes so
[00:28:30 --> 00:28:33] contingent upon these platforms that we know they're no good for us we know they harvest our
[00:28:33 --> 00:28:38] data and they all the terrible things that are associated with them but we still it's like
[00:28:38 --> 00:28:42] we're else we're else but Facebook marketplace can you find all these sweet you know I mean that's
[00:28:42 --> 00:28:46] like you don't have to get totally influenced by it though the more you're aware they're
[00:28:46 --> 00:28:50] influencing you the less affected has on you you know more you're aware of the magic trick you
[00:28:50 --> 00:28:55] like oh that rabbits up at sleep there's just a connectivity that we can't find elsewhere so there's
[00:28:55 --> 00:28:59] this void that we have like we have to use it to fill the void I guess is what I mean you don't like
[00:28:59 --> 00:29:03] you don't like maybe through like that's why I really want to try doing um I've had two or three
[00:29:03 --> 00:29:08] people really pushing me heavy to try to do digital but that's something we're like it's the it's like
[00:29:08 --> 00:29:12] the community and the relationships you get out of it that's just important maybe then the practice of it
[00:29:12 --> 00:29:17] itself like the I don't know that's the way it's been just like maybe in those sort of circles you
[00:29:17 --> 00:29:21] do get that but you just don't get it in a bro you know there's not a lot of broad ways to get it now
[00:29:21 --> 00:29:26] but jiu jitsu is definitely a way to do it it's also a way where you get out all of your aggression
[00:29:26 --> 00:29:31] in a very healthy way in a cooperative way you're doing it with other people that are your friends
[00:29:31 --> 00:29:36] and the beautiful thing about jiu jitsu sparring as opposed to like when I was kickbox and like
[00:29:36 --> 00:29:41] you kind of resented your sparring partner they're fucking you up you know they're rocking you
[00:29:41 --> 00:29:47] whereas in jiu jitsu even if someone taps you a lot you you're still their friend you know you realize
[00:29:47 --> 00:29:51] like oh you got and they'll tell you you can't you can't do that with the right arm the right arm
[00:29:51 --> 00:29:55] arm has to stay tied to your chest because otherwise it once is exposed when I'm trying to
[00:29:55 --> 00:29:59] do is get you to do that so I can go to the other side okay let's try it again I'll show it I'll show
[00:29:59 --> 00:30:01] guys
[00:30:00 --> 00:30:06] And when you do that with people, you're helping your friend beat you next time, but that's the way to get better.
[00:30:06 --> 00:30:09] Like, you know, Eddie Bravo taught me that a long time ago.
[00:30:09 --> 00:30:14] If it was the more you teach people to catch you and the stuff that you do, the more people,
[00:30:14 --> 00:30:17] you'll be able to get it in people that even know it's coming.
[00:30:17 --> 00:30:20] You'll be a little sharpened that technique up even more.
[00:30:20 --> 00:30:24] If you can get people that know what you're doing, and you tell them what you're doing, you can still do it.
[00:30:24 --> 00:30:27] Like, Hicks and Grace used to tell people, I'm going to get you an arm bar on your right arm.
[00:30:27 --> 00:30:28] You're like, the fuck you are.
[00:30:28 --> 00:30:30] And he was still getting it.
[00:30:30 --> 00:30:34] But he was so much better than everybody that he would do that on purpose.
[00:30:34 --> 00:30:41] And there's a beautiful thing about learning something that's very difficult, that prepares you for life.
[00:30:41 --> 00:30:50] Also, the other beautiful thing about you, Jitsu, in terms of your mental health, is that it's so difficult to do that it makes a regular life easy.
[00:30:50 --> 00:30:53] And regular conflict seems to be silly.
[00:30:53 --> 00:30:58] Like sometimes people get super nervous if two people are just yelling at each other and you think a fight may break up.
[00:30:58 --> 00:31:01] If you're like so used to strangling people, that's like totally normal.
[00:31:01 --> 00:31:02] Like, oh, you guys are going to fight?
[00:31:02 --> 00:31:07] Like, you see that in this, you see that in some of the videos that go around where somebody will get broken into,
[00:31:07 --> 00:31:09] like, they're like, it's like the security footage.
[00:31:09 --> 00:31:12] I'm trying to think there was one that went around recently.
[00:31:12 --> 00:31:16] Like, some guy was trying to break into the UFC fighter's truck and he went out there and just kicked his ass.
[00:31:16 --> 00:31:17] Just engaging.
[00:31:17 --> 00:31:18] I think that was a...
[00:31:18 --> 00:31:19] Yeah.
[00:31:19 --> 00:31:23] The guy did that with John Jones.
[00:31:23 --> 00:31:26] John Jones ran out with a shotgun and a fucking Belgian malamo.
[00:31:26 --> 00:31:28] I was like, that's the wrong dude.
[00:31:28 --> 00:31:29] Break it is.
[00:31:29 --> 00:31:30] He's ready.
[00:31:30 --> 00:31:31] And Sean Strickland.
[00:31:31 --> 00:31:32] That was another one.
[00:31:32 --> 00:31:33] Sean Brown.
[00:31:33 --> 00:31:34] That's who I was thinking of.
[00:31:34 --> 00:31:35] I was thinking of that one.
[00:31:35 --> 00:31:36] Yeah.
[00:31:36 --> 00:31:39] There's a lot of, you could fuck with the wrong dude.
[00:31:39 --> 00:31:40] And that happens.
[00:31:40 --> 00:31:43] There's a lot of those wrong dudes out there now.
[00:31:43 --> 00:31:45] There's so many people that are training in martial arts now.
[00:31:45 --> 00:31:46] You never know.
[00:31:46 --> 00:31:49] Like, if you're picking a fight with someone and you don't want to fight, you are rolling.
[00:31:49 --> 00:31:52] Those dudes are a lot scarier in real life than on TV too.
[00:31:52 --> 00:31:53] Like, I...
[00:31:53 --> 00:31:54] Hell yeah.
[00:31:54 --> 00:31:55] I finally got to meet.
[00:31:55 --> 00:31:57] I met Brock Lesnar a couple of times now.
[00:31:57 --> 00:31:58] I've just ran into him randomly.
[00:31:58 --> 00:32:00] And just like the size of his hands.
[00:32:00 --> 00:32:01] You're just like, good.
[00:32:01 --> 00:32:03] Like, what, like, where did this guy come?
[00:32:03 --> 00:32:04] He's just like a machine.
[00:32:04 --> 00:32:05] He's a Viking.
[00:32:05 --> 00:32:07] That's 100% Viking DNA.
[00:32:07 --> 00:32:08] 100%.
[00:32:08 --> 00:32:09] But I don't know.
[00:32:09 --> 00:32:10] There's no extra size.
[00:32:10 --> 00:32:11] I'm aware of it.
[00:32:11 --> 00:32:13] Like, it makes your fist twice the size of a normal man.
[00:32:13 --> 00:32:16] He's just like, yeah, he's just like, maybe his daughter?
[00:32:16 --> 00:32:18] Yeah, his daughter's a shot put champion.
[00:32:18 --> 00:32:20] Like, she's Louise.
[00:32:20 --> 00:32:21] She's a tank.
[00:32:21 --> 00:32:22] Yeah.
[00:32:22 --> 00:32:24] That's just pure Viking genetics, man.
[00:32:24 --> 00:32:27] Those are the people at the front of the boat with a big battle axe.
[00:32:27 --> 00:32:28] And you saw that both.
[00:32:28 --> 00:32:29] Pull up to your village.
[00:32:29 --> 00:32:31] You need to be better start running to those men.
[00:32:31 --> 00:32:34] I just can't imagine having to get in the ring with a guy like that.
[00:32:34 --> 00:32:37] And like, no, you got to be just like, god, like, good luck.
[00:32:37 --> 00:32:38] I know.
[00:32:38 --> 00:32:40] Imagine the guys beat him too.
[00:32:40 --> 00:32:41] Yeah.
[00:32:41 --> 00:32:42] Yeah.
[00:32:42 --> 00:32:43] Yeah.
[00:32:43 --> 00:32:44] Yeah.
[00:32:44 --> 00:32:47] You know, if you're over in beat his ass, came Velázquez beat his ass.
[00:32:47 --> 00:32:48] There's guys better than him.
[00:32:48 --> 00:32:50] There's always a bigger fish.
[00:32:50 --> 00:32:51] Yeah.
[00:32:51 --> 00:32:52] And Kane wasn't even bigger.
[00:32:52 --> 00:32:53] Kane was a bad mother fucker.
[00:32:53 --> 00:32:54] He was like 240.
[00:32:54 --> 00:32:56] He was like 25 pounds lighter than Brock.
[00:32:56 --> 00:32:58] And he still beat his ass.
[00:32:58 --> 00:33:01] Who and who in fighting right now is exciting you.
[00:33:01 --> 00:33:02] Like, coming up into my life.
[00:33:02 --> 00:33:04] There's so many guys.
[00:33:04 --> 00:33:06] There's so many men.
[00:33:06 --> 00:33:08] Did you watch Marob's last fight last weekend?
[00:33:09 --> 00:33:10] But after all, he's brilliant.
[00:33:10 --> 00:33:11] Sean O'Malley.
[00:33:11 --> 00:33:12] Decai is insane.
[00:33:12 --> 00:33:14] He's insane.
[00:33:14 --> 00:33:23] His cardio is like something that everyone who has been involved in the sport for as long as I have is blown away by it.
[00:33:23 --> 00:33:25] The guy's a freak.
[00:33:25 --> 00:33:28] Daniel Kormey went to visit him after he won the title.
[00:33:28 --> 00:33:31] He won the title Saturday night in the sphere in Vegas.
[00:33:31 --> 00:33:32] Beat Sean O'Malley.
[00:33:32 --> 00:33:34] Dominant five round decision.
[00:33:34 --> 00:33:35] Let's just steam roll them.
[00:33:35 --> 00:33:37] The next day, Daniel Kormey goes to visit.
[00:33:37 --> 00:33:39] He's out running.
[00:33:39 --> 00:33:40] Yeah.
[00:33:40 --> 00:33:42] I mean, it doesn't stop.
[00:33:42 --> 00:33:43] Yeah.
[00:33:43 --> 00:33:44] It doesn't stop.
[00:33:44 --> 00:33:53] Just this guy from Georgia, from this war-torn country who is just embraces that fuck and grind at a level that nobody else can compete with.
[00:33:53 --> 00:33:57] And when he gets in the ring, like, no one can match his cardio.
[00:33:57 --> 00:33:58] No one can match his pace.
[00:33:58 --> 00:34:01] He melds the greatest of the greats.
[00:34:01 --> 00:34:04] You see guys like, Omar Nirmagamatoff, who's elite.
[00:34:04 --> 00:34:06] He's world class.
[00:34:06 --> 00:34:08] In any other time, he'd be a world champion.
[00:34:08 --> 00:34:10] And Marob just overwhelming him.
[00:34:10 --> 00:34:12] He seemed just getting overwhelmed by the pace.
[00:34:12 --> 00:34:14] And Marob doesn't even get tired.
[00:34:14 --> 00:34:15] He's a freak.
[00:34:15 --> 00:34:16] So he's trained.
[00:34:16 --> 00:34:18] He's probably trained in Georgia most of his life then.
[00:34:18 --> 00:34:22] Do you think that gives him an advantage like he's been he's trained in, like, sort.
[00:34:22 --> 00:34:27] He maybe his fighting style or is it just like, is he doing the same type of fighting, but just better you think?
[00:34:27 --> 00:34:31] Well, you get to see the revolution of his technique.
[00:34:31 --> 00:34:33] So a lot of it isn't America.
[00:34:33 --> 00:34:36] So it's just his mindset and his, his drive.
[00:34:36 --> 00:34:41] And I think some of it, you know, for us, a hobby did a whole video about him saying he needs to be studied in a lab.
[00:34:41 --> 00:34:46] For us, a hobby who runs TriStar in Montreal, it's like one of the greatest gyms of all time.
[00:34:46 --> 00:34:49] And he's one of the best minds ever in the history of MMA.
[00:34:49 --> 00:34:51] And he's blown away by this guy.
[00:34:51 --> 00:34:56] He's like, there's guys that are on EPO, which is like, you know, that's the cyclist take.
[00:34:56 --> 00:34:59] That makes you have more blood cells.
[00:34:59 --> 00:35:02] And it makes you have more cardio, but it's, you can have a fucking stroke.
[00:35:02 --> 00:35:03] It's like super dangerous to take.
[00:35:03 --> 00:35:07] But that's like, a lot of the, like, tour to France guys get busted for that kind of shit.
[00:35:07 --> 00:35:08] Some fighters get busted.
[00:35:08 --> 00:35:12] He's like, guys that I know that have been on EPO don't have that kind of cardio.
[00:35:12 --> 00:35:13] This is crazy cardio.
[00:35:13 --> 00:35:14] This is like something freakish.
[00:35:14 --> 00:35:19] And he's like, he thinks if some of it's genetic, but Morop says it's not.
[00:35:19 --> 00:35:21] Morop says, oh, he used to get tired.
[00:35:21 --> 00:35:23] He's just, he's a freak.
[00:35:23 --> 00:35:24] He's a freak.
[00:35:24 --> 00:35:26] And he just keeps getting better with his technique.
[00:35:26 --> 00:35:27] He gets better with everything.
[00:35:27 --> 00:35:31] His, that drive is not just for his cardio, that drive is for his whole skill set.
[00:35:31 --> 00:35:34] So he's a fucking monster.
[00:35:34 --> 00:35:37] And then Ilya Taporio, who's fighting, Charles Oliver at the end of the month.
[00:35:37 --> 00:35:38] Like, that guy isn't saying.
[00:35:38 --> 00:35:41] That guy's knocked out two of the greatest feather weights of all time.
[00:35:41 --> 00:35:43] Vulcanowski and Max Holloway.
[00:35:43 --> 00:35:46] Nobody knocked those guys out in featherweight before.
[00:35:46 --> 00:35:47] And he did it.
[00:35:47 --> 00:35:48] And he did it.
[00:35:48 --> 00:35:49] And he made it look easy.
[00:35:49 --> 00:35:52] You know, he made it look like they, like he's just on another level from everybody.
[00:35:52 --> 00:35:55] You know, and now he's moving up to 155 pounds.
[00:35:55 --> 00:35:57] He's like decided to clear it out that division.
[00:35:57 --> 00:35:58] He's moving up.
[00:35:58 --> 00:35:59] Like he's saying.
[00:35:59 --> 00:36:00] Yeah.
[00:36:00 --> 00:36:05] There's guys like that that are just some, they're just, they're, they're level is above everybody else's level.
[00:36:05 --> 00:36:07] And with Ilya, it's everything.
[00:36:07 --> 00:36:09] It's his submissions, his kicks, his punches, everything.
[00:36:09 --> 00:36:10] He does, he can do anything.
[00:36:10 --> 00:36:12] I mean, he does everything perfect.
[00:36:12 --> 00:36:13] All his technique is perfect.
[00:36:13 --> 00:36:16] And he's fucking driven and ultra confident.
[00:36:16 --> 00:36:19] You know, this is an amazing time for the sport man.
[00:36:19 --> 00:36:24] It's a, it's a crazy time because these guys that are coming in look like one fight in the UFC.
[00:36:24 --> 00:36:27] They look like world class contenders like right away.
[00:36:28 --> 00:36:37] What's cool because it seems like it's, it's like a really, it's a really good way to get like a obscure people into the spotlight.
[00:36:37 --> 00:36:43] Like, it doesn't seem, it seems like if you can just go in there and fight good that you, it's like you can really work your way up to the top pretty quick.
[00:36:43 --> 00:36:45] I guess like I guess it does take some fights.
[00:36:45 --> 00:36:49] But like if you're even if you're like the guys that are in the top of the UFC now,
[00:36:49 --> 00:36:52] how many fights do you think it takes them before they rack it like,
[00:36:52 --> 00:36:55] how many big wins is it really just a winner too?
[00:36:55 --> 00:36:56] I guess if they're big enough and they're like,
[00:36:56 --> 00:37:02] it really depends entirely on their skill set and who they're fighting and how good they are when they get into the organization.
[00:37:02 --> 00:37:06] Like, the best example of a quick rise at the top is Alex Pereira.
[00:37:06 --> 00:37:10] But Alex Pereira is one of the greatest kickboxes of all time.
[00:37:10 --> 00:37:15] And Alex Pereira went the entered into the UFC, like a lot of people were completely unaware of him.
[00:37:15 --> 00:37:20] And me as a giant kickboxing fan, he was the guy that I was like,
[00:37:20 --> 00:37:24] when this mother fucker comes over here, bodies are gonna drop man.
[00:37:24 --> 00:37:26] I'm telling you, you ain't never seen nothing.
[00:37:26 --> 00:37:28] And I remember Daniel Cormese saying to be like, really?
[00:37:28 --> 00:37:30] I'm like, dude, I'm telling you.
[00:37:30 --> 00:37:32] I was pointing to him on his debut.
[00:37:32 --> 00:37:34] I go, that's the mother fucker.
[00:37:34 --> 00:37:36] That's the boogie man of boogie man.
[00:37:36 --> 00:37:38] I go, he knocks people into orbit.
[00:37:38 --> 00:37:40] And I was showing him some videos of kickboxing fights.
[00:37:40 --> 00:37:42] And he was like, holy shit.
[00:37:42 --> 00:37:44] I go do everybody he touches.
[00:37:44 --> 00:37:46] He's got the touch of death.
[00:37:46 --> 00:37:48] And then we start steamrowing people in the UFC,
[00:37:48 --> 00:37:50] and he knocked out strictly in one round.
[00:37:50 --> 00:37:54] And the opening fight that he had when he hit that dude with a flying knee
[00:37:54 --> 00:37:56] and just sent him into orbit.
[00:37:56 --> 00:37:58] And I was like, whoa.
[00:37:58 --> 00:38:02] I'm like, yeah, dude, this guy is scary.
[00:38:02 --> 00:38:07] So that guy was within three years was a two division world champion.
[00:38:07 --> 00:38:08] Which is just nuts.
[00:38:08 --> 00:38:10] Like nobody's done that before.
[00:38:10 --> 00:38:14] And you know, defended the light heavyweight title multiple times.
[00:38:14 --> 00:38:15] And just a few years.
[00:38:15 --> 00:38:18] And he's only really been fighting MMA for like five or six years.
[00:38:18 --> 00:38:19] That's the excitement.
[00:38:19 --> 00:38:21] I think of MMA over other athletics.
[00:38:21 --> 00:38:23] Maybe it's just the unpredictability of it
[00:38:23 --> 00:38:26] that like anybody can just come in and catch everybody off guard.
[00:38:26 --> 00:38:27] And you just don't ever know.
[00:38:27 --> 00:38:28] Yes.
[00:38:28 --> 00:38:29] Well, it's specialists.
[00:38:29 --> 00:38:33] So the thing about specialists is if you're a specialist kick boxer,
[00:38:33 --> 00:38:36] which you really need is someone to teach you how to fight on the ground.
[00:38:36 --> 00:38:38] Like, and he had Glover to share.
[00:38:38 --> 00:38:41] Who is also a former UFC light heavyweight champion.
[00:38:41 --> 00:38:44] One of the greatest and an amazing technician.
[00:38:44 --> 00:38:47] And Glover helped him along with all those other training partners.
[00:38:47 --> 00:38:48] Avoid the take downs.
[00:38:48 --> 00:38:49] Learn how to fight off.
[00:38:49 --> 00:38:50] Learn how to fight on the ground.
[00:38:50 --> 00:38:52] Learn how to get back up to your feet.
[00:38:52 --> 00:38:55] When you got a guy who's the best of the best kickboxers.
[00:38:55 --> 00:38:57] Every fight starts standing up.
[00:38:57 --> 00:38:59] So while you're standing there with him.
[00:38:59 --> 00:39:02] This is, you gotta get that kind of ground.
[00:39:02 --> 00:39:03] He got to get that kind of ground.
[00:39:03 --> 00:39:05] This is terrifying.
[00:39:05 --> 00:39:07] And he'll fight with broken toes.
[00:39:07 --> 00:39:08] He fought.
[00:39:08 --> 00:39:10] He's fought so fucked up before.
[00:39:10 --> 00:39:13] He fought when when he fought Yuri Prahaska the first time.
[00:39:13 --> 00:39:15] He had a completely blown out knee.
[00:39:15 --> 00:39:17] Like his knee wouldn't support him.
[00:39:17 --> 00:39:19] He knocked Yuri Prahaska out with a left hook.
[00:39:19 --> 00:39:21] And then he got his knee fixed.
[00:39:21 --> 00:39:22] Kay back fought.
[00:39:22 --> 00:39:24] We're getting an ice him in the second round.
[00:39:24 --> 00:39:26] And he's just different man.
[00:39:26 --> 00:39:28] He fought this last fight with a broken hand.
[00:39:28 --> 00:39:31] And he had a neurovirus.
[00:39:31 --> 00:39:34] And still lost a close decision in the fifth round.
[00:39:34 --> 00:39:36] Maybe it almost, yeah, it almost helped.
[00:39:36 --> 00:39:37] Like, almost helps him.
[00:39:37 --> 00:39:38] Like that.
[00:39:38 --> 00:39:39] Nah, it doesn't.
[00:39:39 --> 00:39:40] It definitely does.
[00:39:40 --> 00:39:43] You could tell his energy was lower in that last fight that it has been in the past.
[00:39:43 --> 00:39:46] Like the Khalil Round Tree fight was a fucking master class.
[00:39:46 --> 00:39:49] And Khalil is like one of the best trackers in the light-hippewi division.
[00:39:49 --> 00:39:51] Alex just pieced him apart.
[00:39:51 --> 00:39:55] I think about what happens after their careers are finished.
[00:39:55 --> 00:39:59] Like what do they, where do they direct all of that energy to?
[00:39:59 --> 00:40:00] Or does it, or does it?
[00:40:00 --> 00:40:05] Is it difficult when you're, is it difficult when you're a high level fighter and then you get out of it?
[00:40:05 --> 00:40:06] Like, oh, it's so difficult.
[00:40:06 --> 00:40:08] Your whole identity is wrapped up in it, you know?
[00:40:08 --> 00:40:13] I just message Sean Strickling the other day because I saw that he was talking about his investments
[00:40:13 --> 00:40:18] and that he's got, he's got 4 million in investments and he's doing really well.
[00:40:18 --> 00:40:21] And then, you know, he's got a plan like Sean is very intelligent.
[00:40:21 --> 00:40:24] And he's wild and crazy, he says crazy ship, but very intelligent.
[00:40:24 --> 00:40:25] And I was very happy.
[00:40:25 --> 00:40:28] And I imagine that makes me feel so good that you've, like,
[00:40:28 --> 00:40:32] you're really thinking about like having money in the bank retirement investments.
[00:40:32 --> 00:40:34] So you're good, you're good forever.
[00:40:34 --> 00:40:39] And he'll always be able to do seminars and things along those lines.
[00:40:39 --> 00:40:42] People, it's very valuable to be like a former champion.
[00:40:42 --> 00:40:45] You can visit gyms and people will line up and pay 50 bucks.
[00:40:45 --> 00:40:48] And you can teach them things that will genuinely help the careers.
[00:40:48 --> 00:40:51] So that a lot of guys have a thing, like me should pay.
[00:40:51 --> 00:40:53] She was just an Austin recently.
[00:40:53 --> 00:40:56] And she went to ways to well to get some work done on her knee.
[00:40:56 --> 00:40:59] And she was out here doing seminars.
[00:40:59 --> 00:41:01] So she's traveling their family around the country.
[00:41:01 --> 00:41:04] And they'll go and she'll teach a seminar to gym.
[00:41:04 --> 00:41:06] And then they'll go, you know, on a RV trip.
[00:41:06 --> 00:41:08] You know, nice family time.
[00:41:08 --> 00:41:09] Yeah.
[00:41:09 --> 00:41:10] Have a good time in between.
[00:41:10 --> 00:41:13] But they can make a lucrative living doing that, which is really nice.
[00:41:13 --> 00:41:16] You know, it's hard for them, the identity things very hard.
[00:41:16 --> 00:41:19] Well, I just wanted to, like the, it seems like some of those people are,
[00:41:19 --> 00:41:22] well, you know, this is totally different than MMA fighters.
[00:41:22 --> 00:41:26] But I look at, like, like, a great example is like, like that David Goggins type of thing,
[00:41:26 --> 00:41:27] where they're like, just at it.
[00:41:27 --> 00:41:31] Like you said, dude, man, like, you fight in the next day you're able to go run.
[00:41:31 --> 00:41:33] It's just like, what happens when all that slows down?
[00:41:33 --> 00:41:34] Do you redirect that somewhere?
[00:41:34 --> 00:41:35] Do you think it's difficult?
[00:41:35 --> 00:41:37] Like, if you don't have somewhere to just, you know,
[00:41:37 --> 00:41:40] you found this really effective way to display all of this.
[00:41:40 --> 00:41:42] Because obviously, those people have got something in them that like,
[00:41:42 --> 00:41:45] drives their spirit to be able to do that.
[00:41:45 --> 00:41:48] Well, I think George St. Pierre has the healthiest model,
[00:41:48 --> 00:41:50] because George still trains almost every day.
[00:41:50 --> 00:41:51] Yeah.
[00:41:51 --> 00:41:56] And George still comes to Austin to train with the Donahers and Gordon Ryan,
[00:41:56 --> 00:42:01] all these elite Jiu Jitsu guys, and they'll still go to Thailand and train Moitai.
[00:42:01 --> 00:42:03] He's a genuine martial artist.
[00:42:03 --> 00:42:07] And maybe he stopped before he destroyed himself too much.
[00:42:07 --> 00:42:08] He definitely dig.
[00:42:08 --> 00:42:09] He definitely dig.
[00:42:09 --> 00:42:10] He's in good.
[00:42:10 --> 00:42:12] Do you think those guys will ever come back?
[00:42:12 --> 00:42:15] Like, like, I know there was rumors about, do you think they would ever,
[00:42:15 --> 00:42:19] do you think for them that it would be beneficial for them to come back and fight once they've been out of it for so long?
[00:42:19 --> 00:42:22] Like, like, like the Tyson fight and stuff.
[00:42:22 --> 00:42:24] Was that, that seemed like, and I don't even know,
[00:42:24 --> 00:42:25] that's a whole another can of worms.
[00:42:25 --> 00:42:29] And I don't, I'm not articulate enough in this space to like give my opinions on things,
[00:42:29 --> 00:42:32] but I just, I would have liked to see Mike Tyson just,
[00:42:32 --> 00:42:34] I don't know, just seem like that just wasn't,
[00:42:34 --> 00:42:36] it didn't seem like he enjoyed that coming back.
[00:42:36 --> 00:42:38] I bet he enjoyed the 20 million bucks.
[00:42:38 --> 00:42:39] He did.
[00:42:39 --> 00:42:40] I bet that's why he did it.
[00:42:40 --> 00:42:41] He did it for money.
[00:42:41 --> 00:42:42] I'm happy that he could do it for money.
[00:42:42 --> 00:42:45] I'm happy that he could make a large amount of money doing something like that.
[00:42:45 --> 00:42:47] That's all say about that.
[00:42:47 --> 00:42:52] But you're not supposed to be getting hit really hard in the head when you're 57 or 58 years old.
[00:42:52 --> 00:42:55] It's probably not the best thing for your health.
[00:42:55 --> 00:42:57] And at a certain point in time,
[00:42:57 --> 00:43:02] I kind of stopped kickboxing for the most part when I was like 30.
[00:43:02 --> 00:43:05] I was like, this is just not good for you.
[00:43:05 --> 00:43:07] You know, I was still sparring,
[00:43:07 --> 00:43:09] and I was acting at the time.
[00:43:09 --> 00:43:12] So I was doing news radio, and I was still going to the gym and kickboxing.
[00:43:12 --> 00:43:15] And you know, sometimes I have like a little black eye that I have to get touched up,
[00:43:15 --> 00:43:18] but make up and shit before I go out to the set.
[00:43:18 --> 00:43:20] And I kept doing Jiu-Jitsu,
[00:43:20 --> 00:43:23] but Jiu-Jitsu, I would get black eyes and Jiu-Jitsu sometimes too.
[00:43:23 --> 00:43:28] But Jiu-Jitsu didn't, I didn't get my head rattled the same way.
[00:43:28 --> 00:43:30] Like, you still accidentally catch a knee sometimes,
[00:43:30 --> 00:43:32] and or you head buddy each other sometimes.
[00:43:32 --> 00:43:34] Something elbow stuff happens.
[00:43:34 --> 00:43:39] But it's not like the constant jabs to the face and kicks to the body.
[00:43:39 --> 00:43:43] And you just get, you're beating your brain up.
[00:43:43 --> 00:43:46] You know, and it's just not good for you.
[00:43:46 --> 00:43:50] And at a certain point in time, like if you're an athlete and you're competing professionally,
[00:43:50 --> 00:43:54] you manage it, you do your best to recover and take care of your health.
[00:43:54 --> 00:43:56] But there's a price you pay.
[00:43:56 --> 00:43:58] And I don't think you should pay that price if you don't have to.
[00:43:58 --> 00:44:02] You know, and that's what, that's the thing about sparring that's like,
[00:44:02 --> 00:44:04] especially if you're sparring with someone who's like a hard hitter,
[00:44:04 --> 00:44:06] and they, they're not that good at pulling punches.
[00:44:06 --> 00:44:07] And then it gets competitive.
[00:44:07 --> 00:44:09] And next thing, you know, you're basically fighting.
[00:44:09 --> 00:44:10] Full on fighting.
[00:44:10 --> 00:44:11] Happens all the time.
[00:44:11 --> 00:44:12] Happens all the time.
[00:44:12 --> 00:44:15] Happens in a lot of gyms that happens more often than not.
[00:44:15 --> 00:44:17] You're actually fighting rather than sparring.
[00:44:17 --> 00:44:18] And just lucky.
[00:44:18 --> 00:44:20] You're not knocking each other unconscious every day.
[00:44:20 --> 00:44:22] You know, because it's like your skill.
[00:44:22 --> 00:44:24] But there's, there's something to be said for that of your fighting,
[00:44:24 --> 00:44:27] because like you got to be aware that there's real consequences to these shots.
[00:44:27 --> 00:44:30] And if someone's pity padding you and sparring,
[00:44:30 --> 00:44:33] maybe you'll develop a false sense of security, you know,
[00:44:33 --> 00:44:34] and someone will crack you.
[00:44:34 --> 00:44:35] You got to be on the edge all the time.
[00:44:35 --> 00:44:37] Like for us, a hobby, who I was talking about earlier,
[00:44:37 --> 00:44:39] would pay sparring partners to try to knock towards
[00:44:40 --> 00:44:41] St. Pierre out.
[00:44:41 --> 00:44:42] He would pay them.
[00:44:42 --> 00:44:43] I want you to try to knock him out.
[00:44:43 --> 00:44:44] Like for us.
[00:44:44 --> 00:44:46] Because you want a George to be like really prepared.
[00:44:46 --> 00:44:48] You know, you're going in there and you know,
[00:44:48 --> 00:44:50] you're going to fight some fucking killer.
[00:44:50 --> 00:44:53] You know, you can't be kind of half, you're, you know,
[00:44:53 --> 00:44:55] you're fighting Carlos Connor.
[00:44:55 --> 00:44:56] He's going to try to take your head off.
[00:44:56 --> 00:44:59] You got to be training with guys that are trying to take your head off.
[00:44:59 --> 00:45:00] Yeah.
[00:45:00 --> 00:45:01] When they're in the middle of those fights,
[00:45:01 --> 00:45:04] is it a lot of muscle memory or are they consciously thinking?
[00:45:04 --> 00:45:06] Like, I feel like a lot of it.
[00:45:06 --> 00:45:08] They've trained so much that it's more automatic, right?
[00:45:08 --> 00:45:10] When they get in that fight.
[00:45:10 --> 00:45:14] Like, like, like the way you see these slow motion
[00:45:14 --> 00:45:16] replays of fights and they're able to, like,
[00:45:16 --> 00:45:18] almost predict their opponent's move and, like,
[00:45:18 --> 00:45:20] react in real time with it and, like,
[00:45:20 --> 00:45:21] just use it to their advantage.
[00:45:21 --> 00:45:23] That's all sort of almost.
[00:45:23 --> 00:45:26] It's not involuntary, but they've, like, trained their muscle memory
[00:45:26 --> 00:45:27] and react that way.
[00:45:27 --> 00:45:28] I guess more so than that level.
[00:45:28 --> 00:45:29] Yeah.
[00:45:29 --> 00:45:31] More so than them having to, like, think, like,
[00:45:31 --> 00:45:32] all here it comes.
[00:45:32 --> 00:45:33] I'm going to, you know,
[00:45:33 --> 00:45:35] it's just so incredible to watch it.
[00:45:35 --> 00:45:37] Like the way it's sometimes those fights are so good.
[00:45:37 --> 00:45:39] They almost, like, it's almost, like,
[00:45:39 --> 00:45:40] choreographed.
[00:45:40 --> 00:45:41] It's so good.
[00:45:41 --> 00:45:43] The way they're able to, like, use their opponent's movements
[00:45:43 --> 00:45:45] and to their own advantage and stuff.
[00:45:45 --> 00:45:47] That's what so crazy to me watching them.
[00:45:47 --> 00:45:50] Just watching how, like, a human being can get to that level
[00:45:50 --> 00:45:51] to where we are.
[00:45:51 --> 00:45:52] Oh, yeah.
[00:45:52 --> 00:45:53] So good, you know.
[00:45:53 --> 00:45:55] When someone's at the elite level, like,
[00:45:55 --> 00:45:58] the highest of high levels, it's an amazing thing to watch.
[00:45:58 --> 00:46:01] Like, there's a guy who's defending his flyway title
[00:46:01 --> 00:46:04] at the end of June, Alexandria, Pantosa.
[00:46:04 --> 00:46:06] He's one of the best fighters of all time.
[00:46:06 --> 00:46:08] I mean, he's so fucking good.
[00:46:08 --> 00:46:10] But he's 125 pounds.
[00:46:10 --> 00:46:13] So people, you know, they don't appreciate him as much as he,
[00:46:13 --> 00:46:17] if that guy was 170, he'd be a fucking superstar.
[00:46:17 --> 00:46:18] He's so good.
[00:46:18 --> 00:46:20] He's so good everywhere.
[00:46:20 --> 00:46:24] Elite black belt on the ground, nasty striking, hyper-aggressive.
[00:46:24 --> 00:46:25] Just dominant.
[00:46:25 --> 00:46:26] Just comes in.
[00:46:26 --> 00:46:27] He has this look in his eyes.
[00:46:27 --> 00:46:29] I'm here to fuck you up.
[00:46:29 --> 00:46:31] And it's awesome to watch.
[00:46:31 --> 00:46:34] I mean, he's, like, when a guy reaches the pinnacle
[00:46:34 --> 00:46:37] of his career, like, when he's at the height of his powers,
[00:46:37 --> 00:46:40] when he's at the peak of his, his performance in career,
[00:46:40 --> 00:46:43] and as a elite MMA fighter,
[00:46:43 --> 00:46:45] it's something to be hold man.
[00:46:45 --> 00:46:46] It really is.
[00:46:46 --> 00:46:48] When you watch a guy just piece a guy up and take him apart,
[00:46:48 --> 00:46:50] like, ah, damn.
[00:46:50 --> 00:46:52] You know, I'd never get bored with it.
[00:46:52 --> 00:46:53] Never.
[00:46:53 --> 00:46:54] Never get bored.
[00:46:54 --> 00:46:55] Call on the fights.
[00:46:55 --> 00:46:56] Never get bored.
[00:46:56 --> 00:46:59] Like, when I know it's a UFC 9, I'm like, oh, baby.
[00:46:59 --> 00:47:00] Here we go.
[00:47:00 --> 00:47:01] It's still good to excited.
[00:47:01 --> 00:47:02] Just like it did at the beginning.
[00:47:02 --> 00:47:03] Yeah.
[00:47:03 --> 00:47:06] For me, he was a two division world champion who sits next to me.
[00:47:06 --> 00:47:07] He gets fired up.
[00:47:07 --> 00:47:09] I mean, he's like, grab on my shoulders.
[00:47:09 --> 00:47:10] Oh, man.
[00:47:10 --> 00:47:11] Here we go.
[00:47:11 --> 00:47:12] Here we go.
[00:47:12 --> 00:47:13] We get so fired up.
[00:47:13 --> 00:47:16] And it's, you know, as far as excitement generated,
[00:47:16 --> 00:47:18] I think it's the most exciting thing in the world.
[00:47:18 --> 00:47:21] I don't think there's anything like two people trying to figure each other out.
[00:47:21 --> 00:47:22] Yeah.
[00:47:22 --> 00:47:25] You know, I mean, and then when someone's in that flow state,
[00:47:25 --> 00:47:26] it's amazing thing to watch.
[00:47:26 --> 00:47:27] It's beautiful.
[00:47:27 --> 00:47:29] When they really hit that flow state,
[00:47:29 --> 00:47:31] and they just, everything is just perfect.
[00:47:31 --> 00:47:32] Oh, man.
[00:47:32 --> 00:47:34] That's so hard to get there.
[00:47:34 --> 00:47:38] It's like an art form that you really can only truly appreciate.
[00:47:38 --> 00:47:41] If you understand the amount of effort that it took to get to that point,
[00:47:41 --> 00:47:44] if you could do a little bit of it, you can do it somewhat.
[00:47:44 --> 00:47:48] You know, you have to be able to do some martial arts to really appreciate what they're doing.
[00:47:48 --> 00:47:50] You know, you can see someone kicks something in the hand and like,
[00:47:50 --> 00:47:51] wow, that's crazy.
[00:47:51 --> 00:47:54] But to really know how hard it is to pull off what he did,
[00:47:54 --> 00:47:56] it's just like,
[00:47:56 --> 00:47:57] yeah.
[00:47:57 --> 00:47:58] It's easy.
[00:47:58 --> 00:47:59] It's easy to watch.
[00:47:59 --> 00:48:02] So we're hip hop where they're just like sucker punch on each other,
[00:48:02 --> 00:48:05] but to watch a guy exhibit that kind of scale on somebody else,
[00:48:05 --> 00:48:08] knowing that like, and not even knowing like I said,
[00:48:08 --> 00:48:11] just meeting like the few UFC fighters that I've met and stuff,
[00:48:11 --> 00:48:13] just looking at him and being like,
[00:48:13 --> 00:48:15] I just do like these these are just animals, you know,
[00:48:15 --> 00:48:18] like you start, and then to watch somebody else be able to exhibit that kind of,
[00:48:18 --> 00:48:21] just to kind of like unleash that kind of skill on him,
[00:48:21 --> 00:48:23] is just, you're right, it's such a raw,
[00:48:23 --> 00:48:24] it unlocks such a,
[00:48:24 --> 00:48:26] and unlocks that sort of monkey part of our brain.
[00:48:26 --> 00:48:27] They're just like, yeah.
[00:48:27 --> 00:48:28] Oh, it's so, yeah.
[00:48:29 --> 00:48:32] It's hard to, yeah, it's just such a, such a human thing, I guess.
[00:48:32 --> 00:48:34] Yeah, like when people are really into cricket,
[00:48:34 --> 00:48:36] someone scores in cricket, they get excited.
[00:48:36 --> 00:48:38] I don't give a fuck,
[00:48:38 --> 00:48:40] but if somebody kicks somebody in the head,
[00:48:40 --> 00:48:41] everybody knows what happened.
[00:48:41 --> 00:48:42] Everybody stands in.
[00:48:42 --> 00:48:43] That's the,
[00:48:43 --> 00:48:46] I think that, that's the same psychology behind chicken fighting,
[00:48:46 --> 00:48:49] which is surprisingly prevalent.
[00:48:49 --> 00:48:51] Like we've recorded this song and all that still,
[00:48:51 --> 00:48:52] but like with the,
[00:48:52 --> 00:48:54] it's kind of the same like that.
[00:48:54 --> 00:48:56] That's just, that's what they do up there.
[00:48:56 --> 00:48:57] They don't hit each other.
[00:48:58 --> 00:48:59] And they gamble.
[00:48:59 --> 00:49:00] That's the big thing.
[00:49:00 --> 00:49:01] It's gambling on chicken fights.
[00:49:01 --> 00:49:02] It's a big deal.
[00:49:02 --> 00:49:04] It's a big deal up there.
[00:49:04 --> 00:49:08] I was just telling a story of the day about this guy that was my landscape,
[00:49:08 --> 00:49:11] that took me to this Mexican neighborhood that he lived in,
[00:49:11 --> 00:49:13] and his buddy had all these chickens,
[00:49:13 --> 00:49:15] like in cages, like all over the place.
[00:49:15 --> 00:49:16] Yeah, these roosters,
[00:49:16 --> 00:49:18] and they had a big pit where they would roast goats,
[00:49:18 --> 00:49:20] and they would just get the chickens out,
[00:49:20 --> 00:49:21] put them in the box and gamble.
[00:49:21 --> 00:49:23] And it was like, I was explaining,
[00:49:23 --> 00:49:25] like you want to talk about like integrated societies.
[00:49:25 --> 00:49:28] This is a completely Mexican neighborhood in L.A.
[00:49:28 --> 00:49:30] None of the signs are in English.
[00:49:30 --> 00:49:31] Everything is in Spanish.
[00:49:31 --> 00:49:32] Everybody spoke Spanish.
[00:49:32 --> 00:49:33] Wow.
[00:49:33 --> 00:49:34] You go down the street here.
[00:49:34 --> 00:49:37] This fucking roosters everywhere, man.
[00:49:37 --> 00:49:40] But it's like that, that's part of their culture.
[00:49:40 --> 00:49:42] It's cruel and awful,
[00:49:42 --> 00:49:44] but so is chicken farming.
[00:49:44 --> 00:49:45] You know?
[00:49:45 --> 00:49:49] They make soup out of the chickens after they have them fight each other.
[00:49:49 --> 00:49:50] It's kind of fucked up.
[00:49:50 --> 00:49:52] But it's, it's that same sort of like,
[00:49:53 --> 00:49:55] it's the same, it goes back to like the Colosseum.
[00:49:55 --> 00:49:56] It's that same kind of thing.
[00:49:56 --> 00:50:00] Like it's that part of our brain that everybody's got some chase.
[00:50:00 --> 00:50:00] to get there.
[00:50:00 --> 00:50:02] But yeah, I've always wondered that with the fighters.
[00:50:02 --> 00:50:04] I've, the worst is dog fighting.
[00:50:04 --> 00:50:05] Yeah.
[00:50:05 --> 00:50:08] That's the one I, you know, that man makes my stomach turn, right?
[00:50:08 --> 00:50:10] That one bothers me because they like fighting.
[00:50:10 --> 00:50:12] They really do, pit bulls love it.
[00:50:12 --> 00:50:14] They're fighting, they're fighting each other in the face
[00:50:14 --> 00:50:15] and wagging their tails.
[00:50:15 --> 00:50:16] They really enjoy it.
[00:50:16 --> 00:50:18] But it's like, girl, I don't do that.
[00:50:18 --> 00:50:19] Don't do that.
[00:50:19 --> 00:50:20] You just like, we don't want that.
[00:50:20 --> 00:50:21] Yeah.
[00:50:21 --> 00:50:22] You know?
[00:50:22 --> 00:50:24] Yeah, maybe it's when it's something you eat,
[00:50:24 --> 00:50:25] you don't feel so bad about it,
[00:50:25 --> 00:50:27] but when it's a dog, it's like,
[00:50:27 --> 00:50:28] I just love dogs.
[00:50:28 --> 00:50:29] It's way too much.
[00:50:29 --> 00:50:31] And that, that to me, you know,
[00:50:31 --> 00:50:32] and I know the dog wants to do it,
[00:50:32 --> 00:50:34] which is even more fucked up.
[00:50:34 --> 00:50:35] You know, they want to fight.
[00:50:35 --> 00:50:36] But they're bred for it.
[00:50:36 --> 00:50:37] That's what's so crazy.
[00:50:37 --> 00:50:38] People are so psyched.
[00:50:38 --> 00:50:40] They bred a dog that wants to fight all the time
[00:50:40 --> 00:50:41] and will fight anything.
[00:50:41 --> 00:50:43] They'll fight bulls.
[00:50:43 --> 00:50:45] They used to use them to grab bulls.
[00:50:45 --> 00:50:46] Yeah.
[00:50:46 --> 00:50:47] Yeah.
[00:50:47 --> 00:50:48] No, dogs might.
[00:50:48 --> 00:50:49] Well, you know where I was at in Virginia.
[00:50:49 --> 00:50:53] We had, I, yeah, I was,
[00:50:53 --> 00:50:55] I don't know if I'd say we were officially dating or not.
[00:50:55 --> 00:50:56] I kind of was hoping we were.
[00:50:56 --> 00:50:58] But I was, there was this girl I used to talk to a lot
[00:50:58 --> 00:51:00] in the middle school when they, you know,
[00:51:00 --> 00:51:02] they weren't, they didn't live too far away
[00:51:02 --> 00:51:04] from Michael Vix plays when all that went down.
[00:51:04 --> 00:51:05] Oh, wow.
[00:51:05 --> 00:51:07] So she actually had some puppies that were originally,
[00:51:07 --> 00:51:08] they never fought.
[00:51:08 --> 00:51:09] They were still puppies when he got busted.
[00:51:09 --> 00:51:12] But they were some of Vix dogs that she had.
[00:51:12 --> 00:51:14] I remember as a kid, and that was like,
[00:51:14 --> 00:51:15] yeah, I remember when all that went down,
[00:51:15 --> 00:51:16] I didn't live, you know,
[00:51:16 --> 00:51:19] we weren't relatively that far away from where all that happened.
[00:51:19 --> 00:51:22] But that was a real eye opening experience for a lot of people.
[00:51:22 --> 00:51:25] Don't like, we, what, that guy's doing that?
[00:51:25 --> 00:51:27] That's crazy.
[00:51:27 --> 00:51:31] But on the same way, I have dogs and humans
[00:51:31 --> 00:51:34] are like at the same level of importance to me almost.
[00:51:34 --> 00:51:36] You know, like, I finally, I didn't,
[00:51:36 --> 00:51:38] it's not in any way to save a place,
[00:51:38 --> 00:51:40] but just like, for me, I've always,
[00:51:40 --> 00:51:42] I'm used to having three or four dogs around,
[00:51:42 --> 00:51:43] because once you train, if you train a couple of dogs
[00:51:43 --> 00:51:45] real good and you get a couple more,
[00:51:45 --> 00:51:48] nine times out of ten, they'll just learn everything from,
[00:51:48 --> 00:51:49] you kind of get this packed mentality.
[00:51:49 --> 00:51:51] And so I've had four for forever.
[00:51:51 --> 00:51:53] And then I'd gotten down the two
[00:51:53 --> 00:51:54] when I lost Hooch, the white shepherd.
[00:51:54 --> 00:51:57] So I finally just got this black German shepherd off this lady,
[00:51:57 --> 00:52:00] who was really, really nice lady, and it wasn't,
[00:52:00 --> 00:52:01] she didn't necessarily neglect the dog,
[00:52:01 --> 00:52:03] but the dog was just a breeders dog.
[00:52:03 --> 00:52:05] So all she did was just have puppies with it.
[00:52:05 --> 00:52:08] And like, here I am, I'm taking this five-year-old black German
[00:52:08 --> 00:52:11] shepherd down, like, to go swimming in the creek with us
[00:52:11 --> 00:52:14] and stuff and like, it was like her first time stepping
[00:52:14 --> 00:52:15] on a stick, you know, she stepped on a stick
[00:52:15 --> 00:52:17] and, like, jump completely in there, like,
[00:52:17 --> 00:52:19] she didn't know what, you know, not within two weeks.
[00:52:19 --> 00:52:20] Now, she's like, swimming in the creek with them
[00:52:20 --> 00:52:22] and running all around, and she acts like she's a farm dog,
[00:52:22 --> 00:52:24] but like, this dog had just kind of been
[00:52:24 --> 00:52:26] in this lady's front yard for years, I guess.
[00:52:26 --> 00:52:28] And just hadn't even gotten it.
[00:52:28 --> 00:52:30] But to me, it's like, here I am, I'm like,
[00:52:30 --> 00:52:32] it's like, you know, they're like, they're my children, you know?
[00:52:32 --> 00:52:36] They just, I can't separate a dog and a human
[00:52:36 --> 00:52:37] and level of input.
[00:52:37 --> 00:52:39] You know, it's like that, like, you're just, like,
[00:52:39 --> 00:52:42] it's like that theoretical scenario where the trains come in
[00:52:42 --> 00:52:44] and you've got to figure out which way to switch the tracks
[00:52:44 --> 00:52:47] and it's like elderly people or dogs and you're like,
[00:52:47 --> 00:52:50] oh, I don't know, but I'm with you.
[00:52:50 --> 00:52:52] I'm a, yeah, I just love dogs.
[00:52:52 --> 00:52:55] I like people more than dogs, but I love dogs.
[00:52:55 --> 00:52:58] But, yeah, people are more important to me.
[00:52:58 --> 00:53:00] But it's close, it's close.
[00:53:00 --> 00:53:03] There's some people that I would kill for my dog.
[00:53:03 --> 00:53:05] Hey, while I'm here, I'm going to go pick up Poppy
[00:53:05 --> 00:53:07] or whatever, I got to, I wish I would have,
[00:53:07 --> 00:53:09] I wish I would have saved him on there.
[00:53:09 --> 00:53:10] I think his name was Poppy or Buddy or something,
[00:53:10 --> 00:53:12] but that little chihuahua at the,
[00:53:12 --> 00:53:13] he made society.
[00:53:13 --> 00:53:14] Oh, I'm going to take him in.
[00:53:14 --> 00:53:16] And I'm like, I don't know, he's really goofy.
[00:53:16 --> 00:53:17] I'm not, man.
[00:53:17 --> 00:53:18] He's like 12 years old or something.
[00:53:18 --> 00:53:20] So he just needs somewhere to go, you know.
[00:53:20 --> 00:53:22] Oh, you'll give him the last few years of his life.
[00:53:22 --> 00:53:23] You're awesome.
[00:53:23 --> 00:53:25] Oh, and then it'll be tell all the other people.
[00:53:25 --> 00:53:27] All of our Anthony came and got me.
[00:53:27 --> 00:53:28] And they're rich man for rich man guy.
[00:53:28 --> 00:53:30] What a sweetheart.
[00:53:30 --> 00:53:31] Hey, he likes me more than people.
[00:53:33 --> 00:53:35] Yeah, we have this as exciting.
[00:53:35 --> 00:53:38] I, the mothership and just being able to go in there
[00:53:38 --> 00:53:40] and do music and stuff is going to mean that.
[00:53:40 --> 00:53:42] So I've got a few, like I brought, I got a friend
[00:53:42 --> 00:53:45] of my name, Craig, who's like, one of my buddies growing up,
[00:53:45 --> 00:53:47] who does just like amateur state.
[00:53:47 --> 00:53:48] He's really funny guy.
[00:53:48 --> 00:53:49] So I got him doing a little bit.
[00:53:49 --> 00:53:52] And I've got hit cock 45, son, John,
[00:53:52 --> 00:53:54] who he does comedy in Chicago right now.
[00:53:54 --> 00:53:56] He's going to do a little stand-up thing there.
[00:53:56 --> 00:53:58] And just, it is be fun.
[00:53:58 --> 00:54:00] I'm just, it'll be real cool.
[00:54:00 --> 00:54:02] I got the guys that opened for me.
[00:54:02 --> 00:54:04] The Davis and brothers are going to do a couple songs.
[00:54:04 --> 00:54:06] They're really good and just, I don't know,
[00:54:06 --> 00:54:09] I've been, this has been like, through all the stress
[00:54:09 --> 00:54:12] and chaos of the last, however, many months of things
[00:54:12 --> 00:54:13] going on and stuff being rearranged and all.
[00:54:13 --> 00:54:15] This has been like my beacon that I've held on to.
[00:54:15 --> 00:54:17] Like, we just got to get to the mothership.
[00:54:17 --> 00:54:20] And then that's everything will work out, you know?
[00:54:20 --> 00:54:22] And we've been really looking forward to having you.
[00:54:22 --> 00:54:24] Everyone in the staff, all the comics, real pumped.
[00:54:24 --> 00:54:25] Everybody's excited.
[00:54:25 --> 00:54:27] I just couldn't believe the reception I got,
[00:54:27 --> 00:54:29] like, even when I came with Tom that first time,
[00:54:29 --> 00:54:31] just how everybody sort of took me in.
[00:54:31 --> 00:54:33] Like, like, I don't know.
[00:54:33 --> 00:54:35] I'm just sort of the, well, also a lot of people don't even
[00:54:35 --> 00:54:37] know who I am, because all they've seen of me
[00:54:37 --> 00:54:40] is like, just the internet stuff and all the political stuff.
[00:54:40 --> 00:54:43] And so it was really surprising that first time,
[00:54:43 --> 00:54:46] even when we went to that mothership, I don't know.
[00:54:46 --> 00:54:48] Just, everybody there just was like, very respectful
[00:54:48 --> 00:54:51] and like, and it just kind of like, welcome movement arms.
[00:54:51 --> 00:54:53] The kind of, I thought I was going in there like really
[00:54:53 --> 00:54:58] like kind of an outsider and it was way more receptive
[00:54:58 --> 00:55:00] than I've ever been in Nashville, you know,
[00:55:00 --> 00:55:02] like with music people.
[00:55:02 --> 00:55:04] Yeah, they just, I don't know, like,
[00:55:04 --> 00:55:07] well, you might come rain all those guys who are just so nice.
[00:55:07 --> 00:55:10] And so just like, you know, you know, they're funny
[00:55:10 --> 00:55:11] and they can make you laugh up on stage.
[00:55:11 --> 00:55:14] But even in person, they're all just like really good people.
[00:55:14 --> 00:55:16] Like, they're all just really genuinely good people, you know?
[00:55:16 --> 00:55:18] Yeah, we've got a great tribe.
[00:55:18 --> 00:55:18] Yeah.
[00:55:18 --> 00:55:19] It's a great tribe.
[00:55:19 --> 00:55:22] And the whole mentality of the club is like that.
[00:55:22 --> 00:55:25] Like everybody that's there is cool.
[00:55:25 --> 00:55:26] You know, we've really not.
[00:55:26 --> 00:55:30] I think in comedy, comedy still, there's a lot of struggle
[00:55:30 --> 00:55:31] in comedy for people to make it.
[00:55:31 --> 00:55:34] I think even more so than in music, like that some of those people
[00:55:34 --> 00:55:37] were telling me stories about like, how tough it is to go,
[00:55:37 --> 00:55:39] you know, trying to make a, make trying to make a career out
[00:55:39 --> 00:55:41] of comedy, like I guess unless you get a big Netflix
[00:55:41 --> 00:55:44] special or you get a big break, like it's paycheck to paycheck
[00:55:44 --> 00:55:46] for a long time, maybe for some of those guys.
[00:55:46 --> 00:55:48] Like until they get, or until they get to where they're like
[00:55:48 --> 00:55:52] a regular at a big club like that, you're just off, you know,
[00:55:52 --> 00:55:54] you're out, you're out putting yourself into a very vulnerable
[00:55:54 --> 00:55:58] position a lot where people can just say, Oscar, that guy, you know?
[00:55:58 --> 00:56:00] It's like you have to do that to get fit at it.
[00:56:00 --> 00:56:03] But I think I think they have some appreciation for it
[00:56:03 --> 00:56:06] that maybe other people don't, like they're, like it, like I
[00:56:06 --> 00:56:07] think that's, I pick up on that.
[00:56:07 --> 00:56:11] Like they get this, they get that everybody in there is struggle
[00:56:11 --> 00:56:13] in trying to make it and have put a lot of their heart
[00:56:13 --> 00:56:16] and effort into it and it just seems like it's, there's a lot
[00:56:16 --> 00:56:19] of space in there for each, for everybody and stuff, yeah.
[00:56:19 --> 00:56:20] 100%.
[00:56:20 --> 00:56:22] Everybody realizes that there's only one way to do it.
[00:56:22 --> 00:56:23] You got to work hard for a long time.
[00:56:23 --> 00:56:25] It's the only way, it's one of the few things in life
[00:56:25 --> 00:56:28] that there's no shortcut to developing material
[00:56:28 --> 00:56:29] and get a good at stand-up.
[00:56:29 --> 00:56:30] It's a 10 year process.
[00:56:30 --> 00:56:32] You get a 10 year degree.
[00:56:32 --> 00:56:34] You want to actually become a real stand-up.
[00:56:34 --> 00:56:36] It's probably about 10 years.
[00:56:36 --> 00:56:37] 10 years of grinding.
[00:56:37 --> 00:56:40] And for a lot of people like, oh, that's too long.
[00:56:40 --> 00:56:41] It is too long.
[00:56:41 --> 00:56:43] Yeah, so I most people don't do it.
[00:56:43 --> 00:56:45] But if you could do it, the people that are doing it
[00:56:45 --> 00:56:47] and have been doing it for like 10 plus years,
[00:56:47 --> 00:56:49] like all those people hanging out in the green room,
[00:56:49 --> 00:56:50] they're all so cool.
[00:56:50 --> 00:56:52] It's a lot like jujitsu in that regard.
[00:56:52 --> 00:56:55] It's like people that appreciate the difficulty of something
[00:56:55 --> 00:56:58] and are really obsessed with getting better at it.
[00:56:58 --> 00:57:00] And obsessed with helping other people get better at it, too.
[00:57:00 --> 00:57:02] Because also like jujitsu, the more people
[00:57:02 --> 00:57:03] that you have around you that are really funny,
[00:57:03 --> 00:57:06] the funnier you'll get, everybody has to be sharp
[00:57:06 --> 00:57:08] because the whole show, like sometimes I'll do these
[00:57:08 --> 00:57:10] Joe Rogan and friends show.
[00:57:10 --> 00:57:14] And it's fucking a son, a mod, Brian Simpson, Tony,
[00:57:14 --> 00:57:17] hinge, clips, Shane, Gillis, Mark, and then I go up.
[00:57:17 --> 00:57:19] Like it's like the show's an hour and a half old
[00:57:19 --> 00:57:21] before I even get on stage.
[00:57:21 --> 00:57:23] So it's like you have to stay sharp, you have to.
[00:57:23 --> 00:57:25] And if you're not, you got to pick up the slack,
[00:57:25 --> 00:57:27] you got to figure it out, get back to the laptop,
[00:57:27 --> 00:57:31] let's go, you got to rewrite, do this, do that.
[00:57:31 --> 00:57:32] But that's what we're all doing, you know?
[00:57:32 --> 00:57:38] We're all, it's a vibrant place that there's a mindset
[00:57:38 --> 00:57:38] attached to that place.
[00:57:38 --> 00:57:40] It's very positive.
[00:57:40 --> 00:57:41] That makes me real happy.
[00:57:41 --> 00:57:43] And I'm real happy that you're going to be there this week.
[00:57:43 --> 00:57:44] Yeah, I think.
[00:57:44 --> 00:57:46] Yeah, I think this mothership thing's got a long future.
[00:57:46 --> 00:57:49] I had of it in that sense of just reshaping.
[00:57:49 --> 00:57:52] I don't know, I just, it's like a, it is kind of a beacon
[00:57:52 --> 00:57:54] right now and a, like, I don't know,
[00:57:54 --> 00:57:56] it's like, there's a big light shining up in the sky
[00:57:56 --> 00:57:57] and every, that's kind of where everybody's looking.
[00:57:57 --> 00:58:00] It seems like in that, you know, it's up.
[00:58:00 --> 00:58:02] And even with Kill Tony, it's just cool that they,
[00:58:02 --> 00:58:04] that's the coolest part about that is it's like you can just go
[00:58:04 --> 00:58:07] where I didn't there, anybody can go right in there
[00:58:07 --> 00:58:09] and give it their all, you know?
[00:58:09 --> 00:58:11] For better, for worse, like you might make it.
[00:58:11 --> 00:58:13] Look, you might be William Montgomery, you know?
[00:58:13 --> 00:58:16] You might be Cam Patterson, you might be Hans Kim,
[00:58:16 --> 00:58:18] or any of these people that have like legitimate careers
[00:58:18 --> 00:58:19] now because of that show.
[00:58:19 --> 00:58:19] Yes.
[00:58:19 --> 00:58:21] It's pretty awesome.
[00:58:21 --> 00:58:24] Oliver Anthony, this weekend, sorry, everybody.
[00:58:24 --> 00:58:25] It's all sold out.
[00:58:25 --> 00:58:27] You're not going to be able to get in, but I'm fucking pumped.
[00:58:27 --> 00:58:28] I can't wait.
[00:58:28 --> 00:58:30] Yes, and we say thank you for being here, man.
[00:58:30 --> 00:58:31] And thanks for the podcast.
[00:58:31 --> 00:58:32] It was a lot of fun.
[00:58:32 --> 00:58:32] Thank you.
[00:58:32 --> 00:58:33] Yeah, I really enjoyed it very much.
[00:58:33 --> 00:58:36] And it's great to see you find your place, man.
[00:58:36 --> 00:58:36] You're getting it.
[00:58:36 --> 00:58:39] You got it, you know, like you're, you're here now.
[00:58:39 --> 00:58:40] You're established.
[00:58:40 --> 00:58:42] And beginning, you're like, what the fuck is happening now?
[00:58:43 --> 00:58:43] You got a plan.
[00:58:43 --> 00:58:46] It was so many pitfalls and so many things.
[00:58:46 --> 00:58:50] But it's a, it's a contribution of, I'd say, you know,
[00:58:50 --> 00:58:53] like at the very beginning, you, Jamie Johnson, David Kushner,
[00:58:53 --> 00:58:55] and just a couple people who were like,
[00:58:55 --> 00:58:57] had been in it for a while and were able to, well,
[00:58:57 --> 00:58:59] with David, you know, he was fairly recent,
[00:58:59 --> 00:59:01] but we were both, but just those people
[00:59:01 --> 00:59:04] just being able to guide me along at the first six months
[00:59:04 --> 00:59:06] was when I could have really slipped up hard.
[00:59:06 --> 00:59:08] And like, could have just, I just was so thankful
[00:59:08 --> 00:59:11] that I got through all that without being married to anybody
[00:59:11 --> 00:59:14] or any conflict, like, at least everything's still.
[00:59:14 --> 00:59:15] No, you did the right way.
[00:59:15 --> 00:59:16] Yeah, you did the right way.
[00:59:16 --> 00:59:18] So I appreciate the confidence there,
[00:59:18 --> 00:59:20] because it's a terrifying, you mean,
[00:59:20 --> 00:59:22] you mean, you been going to work every day
[00:59:22 --> 00:59:25] for some guy that you hate and some job you hate,
[00:59:25 --> 00:59:28] for so long for like 50 grand a year.
[00:59:28 --> 00:59:32] And then some dude is like showing you, like, you know,
[00:59:32 --> 00:59:34] like, and they have a really convincing way of doing it.
[00:59:34 --> 00:59:35] Just like, think about how easy you can get prayed
[00:59:35 --> 00:59:38] into buying some shit, use car on a lot.
[00:59:38 --> 00:59:40] These people are like that, but like, they're like,
[00:59:40 --> 00:59:42] they're like the professional UFC fighters
[00:59:42 --> 00:59:44] of psychological warfare.
[00:59:44 --> 00:59:46] Like, they're going to make you feel like you're so stupid
[00:59:46 --> 00:59:48] and like, you've just tricked everybody for five minutes
[00:59:48 --> 00:59:50] and you better do it while it lasts.
[00:59:50 --> 00:59:53] But if you don't come with us, it's never going to make it.
[00:59:53 --> 00:59:56] You're never going to make it, but you were right.
[00:59:56 --> 00:59:57] They were wrong.
[00:59:57 --> 00:59:58] And I don't care if nothing, like I said,
[00:59:58 --> 01:00:00] if nothing else ever comes of this, this has been.
[01:00:00 --> 01:00:02] just such a blessing to be able to just meet all the people
[01:00:02 --> 01:00:05] I have and experience it and like, it's just cool, man.
[01:00:05 --> 01:00:07] I don't care, I don't care where it goes from here.
[01:00:07 --> 01:00:10] I'm just totally, I'm just enamored by it all.
[01:00:10 --> 01:00:13] It's just been just another dimension I'm living in, dude.
[01:00:13 --> 01:00:16] I don't know, it's like not real life, but it's beautiful.
[01:00:16 --> 01:00:17] Yeah.
[01:00:17 --> 01:00:18] All right, thanks for being here.
[01:00:18 --> 01:00:19] Yes, sir. Thank you.
[01:00:19 --> 01:00:21] I'll give you a couple more years.
[01:00:21 --> 01:00:22] Fuck yeah, couple more.
[01:00:22 --> 01:00:23] Fuck it.
[01:00:23 --> 01:00:24] Yeah, all right, bye everybody.
