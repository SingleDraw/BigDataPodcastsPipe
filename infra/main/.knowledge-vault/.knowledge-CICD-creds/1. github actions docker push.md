ok, what if my terraform provision script is runned via github actions and i provision this way docker registry to which i then need to push build images on github environment? then i should output credentials to my registry to github secrets right?

Exactly! That's a great insight. When using GitHub Actions for CI/CD, you need to output the registry credentials so GitHub can push images to your Azure Container Registry. Let me show you how to set this up properly:## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to set these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:## Key Points:

1. **Yes, you need outputs.tf** when using GitHub Actions - it's how GitHub gets the ACR credentials

2. **The flow is**:
   - Terraform provisions ACR → outputs credentials
   - GitHub Actions uses those credentials → pushes Docker images
   - Deployment uses images from ACR

3. **Security**: The ACR credentials are also stored in Key Vault for your applications to use, but GitHub Actions gets them directly from Terraform outputs

4. **Two places for secrets**:
   - **GitHub Secrets**: For Azure authentication (service principal)
   - **Key Vault**: For application secrets (connection strings, etc.)

Would you like me to explain any part of this workflow in more detail?
