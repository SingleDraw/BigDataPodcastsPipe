Great idea! You can automatically set GitHub secrets during the Terraform provisioning process. Here are two approaches:## Alternative Approach: Using Azure CLI in Terraform## Required GitHub Secrets Setup## Benefits of This Approach:

1. **One-time setup**: You only need to manually set Azure credentials + GitHub token once
2. **Automatic sync**: ACR credentials are automatically updated in GitHub when they change
3. **No manual copying**: No need to copy/paste values between Azure and GitHub
4. **Version controlled**: Your secret names and structure are in code
5. **Consistent**: Same approach works for all environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Which approach to choose:

- **GitHub Provider (Recommended)**: More reliable, better error handling
- **Local-exec**: Simpler if you already have GitHub CLI set up

The workflow becomes much simpler since Terraform handles setting the secrets automatically, and your GitHub Actions can just use them directly!

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail?
